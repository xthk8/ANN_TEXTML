As an owner of another Belkin MagSafe Car Vent Mount (Model WIC002btGR), I thought I would "upgrade" to a mount that charged as well. This was a big mistake since this mount is vastly inferior to their own product.First, it is extremely loose and impossible to a reasonable position after a phone is removed. The non charging mount had a very stiff tilt that held very strong after an optimal position was found.Second, the size is a huge issue since is much smaller. This makes it difficult to position phone. The other mount was the same width as the base iphone and allowed both the phone and mount to be gripped at the same time. This also allowed the mount to be adjusted while the phone was still connected. On this mount the phone must be removed since the magnet is very weak and the phone will detach if you try to adjust it at all.Third, the magnet is incredibly weak and does not hold the phone near as well as an official Magsafe or even Belkin's other magsafe products. With or with a case makes no difference. I have zero confidence in this product safely holding my phone through bumpy roads.
