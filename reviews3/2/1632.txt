I bought these to label my twins clothes for preschool. They worked well with the label maker and I was able to make very nice looking labels. Getting them to stay on their clothes was another matter. I used parchment and ironed them on using the hottest settings possible. Almost all came off after 4 or 5 washings (cold/ warm water in top loader HE machine normal settings) some clothes went into the dryer others did not. The ink didn't fade too much but the label itself lost the crisp shiny quality that it had in the beginning.Overall disappointing especially as I dont have the time or inclination to sew all the labels into their clothes.
