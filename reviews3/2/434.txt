These headphones were used daily. They are very large around the head, but I was able to make them work. I should have listen to the reviews, because the side with the microphone did snap from the headband and is dangling by the wire like many others have reviewed. Ultimately the headphones no longer work, because when this side snapped off the headband, the other side is now not providing any sound.
