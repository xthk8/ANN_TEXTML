The good:*The active cancelling seems to be ok.The bad:*glasses wearers, DO NOT BUYThe tops of my ears hurt. These do not fully cover your ear so they place stress on your middle to upper ear exterior. I have a small head and have to make the headset larger to keep it off my upper ear, which then makes them fall off if I bend my head slightly to look at the keyboard or a notepad.stopped using it 4 days ago and my ears still hurt. Since it doesn’t fully cover the ear, the ear pressed hard against your glasses with added pressure from the ear pads.*The microphone is flimsy and you can easily be heard breathing on the mic almost anywhere you put it unless it’s above your nose, and then your voice is far away for callers*the ear swivels are flimsily built. Idk how long they would last.This feels like a cheap headset, and it’s very much not cheap.What you are paying for is active noise cancellation.That’s it.Returned for full refund.Not worth the money
