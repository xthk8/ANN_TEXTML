The headphones keep disconnecting after a period of time while I’m using them during teams meetings. It’s so awkward because they will sometimes disconnect while i’m talking and I have to turn them off and on for them to connect again. I thought the auto disconnect happened when they weren’t being used.I have reset them, installed all the updates and I use the app and the problem continues.Also the fit is comfortable to use at the office. I wouldn’t use them for exercise because they’re actually pretty loose fitting and move around if I move my head forward or backwards. I doubt they would work for running. Maybe I have a smaller head since I’m a women.
