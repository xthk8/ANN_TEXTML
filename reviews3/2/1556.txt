I have an older MacBook we use periodically and wanted to have something to hook up to one of our extra monitors to watch movies. This did the job but I don’t know how well this will last. It is working but sometimes I have to jiggle the connections for it to register. I have an older wire I bought from Apple years back that I use with my old 2013 MacBook Air and that thing never had this problem. Not sure if it’s just a bad wire but still working so not worth the hassle to return so ended up keeping it.
