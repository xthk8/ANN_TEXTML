I've had these for a solid 2-3 months and were excellent workout and everyday buds.The sound quality was the best I've heard out of all the sub $50 earbuds I've had in my life including wired and wireless. I heard sounds in songs I've never noticed before because the ones I used to own were trash. So it was a bug step up for me. Battery life was also a big plus on these. I don't like the trend of small earbud cases. It's idiotic in my opinion because earbuds are supposed to be utility and last. The battery life on the buds themselves is also amazing.The workout part was alright and stayed in my ear but I did have to push them back in at least twice during each workout because of sweat buildup. I was doing jumprope though so it's a tough test against earbuds. During weightlifting sessions they pretty much stayed in the whole time.My issue with these is the seal of the rubber where you press the buttons. After pressing them a few times every workout for play/pause the seal came undone and the water resistance was gone. I woke up one day and the right earbud stopped working. It sucks they have this problem because they're solid otherwise.The other issue I have is the rubber around the earbuds loses it's tension like others have said after a couple months and it comes loose often and even when the earbuds are already in my ear.I'll update the review if Soundcore reaches out.
