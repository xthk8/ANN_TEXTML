I bought camera films a couple of times, however this time when I correctly placed the film cart into my camera, it wouldnâ€™t print any pictures. The cartridge got jammed and stuck in and nearly broke my camera on the way out. I tried calling but was told nothing could be done since I ordered from Amazon. Considering this was half the product, I have rated two stars but if something is done to rectify the issue I will change my rating accordingly
