Update: item has been returned! Not happy with a used item that I bought at full price. Expected more out of it and it didnâ€™t live up to what I expected!After hooking up this device it works as it should. The only flaw was I know that it was a returned item. When I receive it , I took it out of the box and the headset base you can tell had been returned from another customer. It had dust all over it and smear marks on the front as if it was wiped off with something like a wipe or some cleaning spray . I had to really work hard to clean off the marks and clean it back up. Wish for the money that I paid for this device that I would have received a new one like I paid for not something that someone returned.
