I love the look, feel, and over all fit. BUT they loosen as the day goes by and I have to sit there attempting to retighten the buckle. The buckle has already lost paint and going from black to looking chipped from black to bare metal underneath which is just poor quality to not even have on 5 days and it doing this. I don’t shower or sleep with my watch so I don’t know why it’s quickly going down hill. I’m hoping all the bands don’t do it but the blue and green have so far.
