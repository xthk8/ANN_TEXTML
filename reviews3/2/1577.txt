Really wanted this to work. In fact I was rooting for it to work. But unfortunately it didn't, and I'm not too surprised. I have an extremely temperamental I-INC external monitor from the pre-historic age that cuts in and out on initial startup from pretty much any computer. This mini displayport cable was for my mid-2012 Macbook Pro that still runs like a champ, but only connects to the monitor with a very specific displayport to HDMI adapter. The amazon basics wire looked well made and had a great protective sleeve over it, but the most that happened with the signal was manic flickering. I tried every trick in the book to make it work to no avail. This review and rating is specifically based off my uncommon scenario, so I wouldn't let it be off putting in the event that you have a monitor that isn't finicky. Or maybe I got a dud, who knows.
