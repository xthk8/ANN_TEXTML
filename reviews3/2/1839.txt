Great sound lousy app & battery. App is too hard 2 work, has fits, can't even get battery info in Bluetooth mode. Makes no sense how hard it is to connect on a different network & the battery is TRASH! Doesn't last the advertised 11 hours, more like 4 hours. Battery drains even when turned off. The reason you buy this is 4 great sound w long battery & w/o the battery then it doesn't work. A waste of time. The app isn't intuitive, & it's too hard to find stuff including your amazon Playlist.
