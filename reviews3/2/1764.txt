The seller is great to work with it product breaks early on. Product just does not last very long. If only need for a month the product does what is needed. First order came already broken with lights flashing and would not turn on. Seller sent a new one right away. Bought a second light and broke within three months of use. Only used about once a week before the lights stopped working
