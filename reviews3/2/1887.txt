the film prints dark. i could only see anything well in the pictures if i went outside while its sunny, and even then its still dark compared to what it actually looked like. i would not reccomend using this taking pictures if you're inside. it might just be that it prints dark on purpose, because i think my last film i got with the camera also printed dark. overall, 2/5. disappointing but functional in the right environment.
