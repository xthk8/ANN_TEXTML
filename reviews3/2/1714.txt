The sound when used with a lav mic is stunning, However, when used without is unpredictable. The battery life is not great, but the main reason for the two stars is that I had two that stopped working for no reason what so ever (one I already got replacement for). I have been waiting to hear from their customer reps for a 3 days now, only to get a useless email about updating my pc software that has nothing to do with the issue, and now waiting again (the software never prompts you to update).Also, there is no way to download all the audio files, instead you will have to export individual files that were split into 30 mins each only thru the software (the must annoying thing ever).
