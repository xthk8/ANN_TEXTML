Hey, you.. yeah, you. I would not order these if I were you. I bought them thinking they would maybe sound really good from so many good reviews on here and some saying they think they’re like Apple AirPods. They don’t sound like AirPods. My brother has some AirPods and I’ve used them before and they sound great, these not so much.. the sound quality isn’t good to me. As soon as I tried a song to listen to on them they have this horrible fuzziness I noticed, maybe that’s not the word...tinniness? Tinny sounding and crackly someone said. I agree, that’s what they sound like. I tried to give them more a chance and try them for longer with other songs but they still have the same problem. This fuzzy, tinny sound to them. I don’t like it, it hurts my ears. :/ I like nice clear sound quality. I was thinking what I should rate this as, 2 or 3 stars cause they might be ok to some people. But unless you like a fuzzy, tinny crackly sound that you notice in the song or whatever you’re listening to with them, you probably won’t like these. That kind of thing really bothers me so I’m returning them. They have a nice rose gold color and cute case, but it’s not worth it for the sound to be bad. I also had trouble connecting them at first. They just would not show up on my iPad, then finally they did. I noticed other people said they had the same problem. I don’t know about the battery life cause I didn’t use them long enough to see how long they last. But the sound is bad. I have some Boltune earbuds I got before here off Amazon and they’re around the same price but they sound a lot better than these. They sound pretty good. Even though those are fine I was still looking for other kinds of earbuds to try that could maybe sound more like how the AirPods sound, but these aren’t even close. AirPods are clear sounding and don’t have a horrible fuzziness, tinniness to the sound. So I’m gonna get other earbuds to try.
