MAIN ISSUEPlease be aware that this is a VIEW-ONLY camera. It does not implement any of ACTUAL surveillance technology, such as pre-record, post-record, triggers, ftp, sftp. Perhaps if you can record your browser window somehow (i.e. obs studio) you can potentially record.QUALITYDespite this cameras huge draw back of not being able to record, the resolution and light capture is pretty decent. However it is only 1fps, not 24fps, as advertised.
