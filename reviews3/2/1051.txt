I was able to make 2 color prints with the cartridge, then it was showing to change cartridge. The print quality was excellent, for the 2 pages it did print. It had ink in it, but it had to be changed before I could finish the pages. I needed to finish the papers, so I went to Walmart to get one. Finished it that evening. Still using that same cartridge from Walmart, without any problems. I have never had this issue before with HP cartridges.
