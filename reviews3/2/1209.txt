I ordered 2 of these and tried both different colors and I must say at first it feels super good material and I must say it is definitely better than the 4 other airpod pro cases that I ordered but I did like this one. I used it for 1-2 months and it now feels like the material is starting to wear off and the top cover for the case keeps falling off. I do feel that happens to most cases and maybe the durability can improve because now that some time has passed I am starting to see scratches on the case, i don’t know if that’s from the case or not but I’m disappointed that I get a case that can’t do the job to keep airpod case from scratches.
