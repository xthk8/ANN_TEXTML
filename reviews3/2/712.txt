I have a Samsung Galaxy. This thing works fine BUT I have to prop it up on the stand (by putting an opened pack of Post-It notes behind it on the stand) to make my phone the correct angle to see the screen while video chatting. If I don't prop it forward the angle is too wide and people see only the top of my head. The other thing is I can't use the buttons on the bottom of my phone when its in the stand, the stand gets in the way, so I have to take it off the stand to open an app, or close an app... its frustrating. It does hold my phone so I can't say it doesn't work, but it could be designed better in my opinion.
