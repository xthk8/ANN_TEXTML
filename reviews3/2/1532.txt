its a cute popsocket and the sticker is staying on my case really well but the top keeps falling off because of the swappable feature. its really annoying and no matter how secure i think ive replaced it it keeps falling off. i think ive dropped my phone more in the last week since i put this on than a week without a popsocket. cant find any without the swap top feature either so its really disappointing
