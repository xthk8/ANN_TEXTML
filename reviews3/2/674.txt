Writes smoothly, no scratching problems but the deal-breaker is the offset created by the tip. Lines created do not always begin at the very tip of the pen, but rather, inside or just a little bit closer to your hand from the tip of the pen.If the metal portion of these tips were a little shorter, this would likely solve the issue.I was dead set on absolutely loving these until I found them to be less accurate than the stands are tips.
