I ordered 4 of these surge protector strips and after a few weeks, the power button on one strip started flickering every once in awhile. Not long after, the switch was dim and continuously flickering. Then the next 2 strips started doing the same thing. Several months later, all strips now have dim, constantly flickering power switches. I replaced 15-20 year old cheap power strips with these and the old ones never did this. I’ve only had these for 8 months and I’m just replacing all of them at this point.
