Not sure if these were old, damaged, or what, but the results were awful. I have been using disposable cameras for 30+ years, and have never had such poor results. There were splotches across the prints, wash outs, and use of flash had no effect on the end results.Kodak usually makes great stuff, but this was pretty disappointing.
