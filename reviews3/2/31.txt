tl;dr: If you use this camera in a relatively active setting, expect it to break because shaking it up a bit can break it. Go for mini series, far cheaper.I've gone through three of these cameras already just because I love the wide format so much. But I think after this third one I'm done with it. The first one I bought was DOA, and somehow a renewed version was in perfect working condition in comparison. The second died after I kept it in a shoulder bag loosely while I was at an amusement park. The third one eventually died for similar reasons. I wouldn't hound Fujifilm so hard for this if there was at least another accessible alternative for this film that was more robust. If you purchase this camera, protect it well when using it. A padded camera bag will suffice, and don't toss the bag around lol.The settings can be pretty finnicky too, sometimes gauging whether or not you should use the light or dark settings can cause you to end up with several shots that are under or overexposed. I wish I could have used this enough to have gotten used to the settings, but the novelty of it isn't worth the cost of film and using it that often. I think that the mini cameras are surprisingly more durable and way more affordable to replace or buy film for. I definitely got the wow factor from people for using this particular kind of film, but I would say it isn't worth it. Just go for the mini series and enjoy the instant film/analog novelty for cheaper. $1 a shot adds up when you like to shoot a lot.
