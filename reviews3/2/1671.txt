In the beginning they were amazing but I noticed one thing after buying these twice once for a gift and another for myself the system sucks or for me atleast they dont stay connected they will randomly disconnect and every time i put them in i have to change it from ambient sound to noise cancellation. Then there is the life spand which in my opinion for 200 dollars is a scam ive had them for only 4 months and they are already showing audio issues i will occasionally have a jet sound or static noise. I will admit i listen to alot of music but for 200 dollars i should get minimum 12-16 months of use before audio issues i am very disappointed and truly wish i could receive a refund
