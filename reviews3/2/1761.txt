Overall, the product is assembled nicely and collapses easily for flat storage, but some of the backdrops were made out of what seems like construction paper. The red, green, and blue backdrops were made out of this material. It creases & tears very easily and will show up in your photos. The white, black, and yellow ones are made out of a plastic folder like material. This is a much better material for the backdrop, and I wish all of them were made out of this material. Also, the wire seems very poorly connected, as the light flickers If you move it. You will have to mess with the diffuser to not get it to cast a ring reflection on your product if it's especially glossy. This is likely a product that you eventually upgrade out of when you figure out what you want out of it. Great for beginners, but leaves a lot to be desired.
