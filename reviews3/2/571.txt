The material is a rubber that grabs everything and that's the best part of this review. The heads on them fit weird, they can be very snug going in and then just fall right out. One of my plugs came "pre-bent" but it still works ok. Although all three of these cords work, they don't seem to charge as well/quickly as any of the other cords I have. I haven't thrown them away but I wouldn't buy the again. Also, I have cats and one of my cats is attracted to the cord material on these.
