Although, my package was shipped relatively quickly (1 day), undamaged, and vacuum sealed, the yellow toner did not register as having any toner. It was the last of the three in the package installed, each separately. We'll see what customer service says. This snafu has caused us to be inconvenienced in a small print project that should have been able to be completed at home. Now, we have to spend money at a print facility to get the job done. So, disappointing. Time wasted in completing our project and having to write a review and be on hold on the phone.
