This was sold as an OEM cartridge. The box was sealed and did not appear to be tampered with. But after printing only a few (3) pages of a colorful page, the yellow ink ran out. The greens that were supposed to be printed came out only shades of blue. Usually these cartridges last MUCH longer. Very disappointed!
