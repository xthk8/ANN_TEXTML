With my iPad plugged in and laying on the bed I started to hear the charging chime over and over. I wasn’t touching the tablet or the charging cable, but the bed was moving as I worked on projects. I started carefully moving the iPad around with no chime. I then carefully started moving the cable and noticed the chime every time the cable was moved in one particular direction. I could see wires through the spaces in the connector at the “male” end (the end that plugs into the tablet). I have had the cable for 6 months, and have not handled it roughly… but the iPad is often picked up and used with the cable plugged in. This is quite disappointing. UPDATE: Did a jury-rig fix by putting a splint on it, but still get chimes and now the “accessory not compatible” message, so I traded it with one of the other cables that it came with and that I was using on another device. I’m not expecting this 2nd cable to last long. It looks so sturdy, so heavy duty, but it’s got a major weak point, a major flaw. Still not a happy camper.
