I'll start by saying this is my first negative Amazon review ... ever. But since I religiously read others' reviews, I felt it was only fair to share my experience. On a positive, you can't beat the price and availability. And it worked fine for 25% of the cartridge. Then it jammed up. I spent an hour trying to re-spool, only to discover the issue was defective tape. The cartridge suddenly started sending out backing only - the waxy bifurcated stuff you peel off the back). Only this backing was sticky. The cartridge was printing was on clear, *non-sticky* cellophane-like stuff. Suffice to say the sticky backing clogged up the mechanisms and there was no going back. Issues happen, but I was really shocked to see they won't except returns after 90 days. I can't imagine going through a cartridge in 90 days...I'll buy again, but as Karen mentioned, do NOT stock up.UPDATE: This guy is my new hero. Following his instructions, I was able to repair the cartridge! Note: do not, under any circumstances, tip the cartridge upside down while you're working on it. Or you'll spend two hours respooling tape and ribbon. Had I not done that, it would have been fixed in 30 min. What a great help!http://mye-life.blogspot.com/2010/12/how-to-fix-tz-tape-cartridge-for-label.html
