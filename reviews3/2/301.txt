I was excited about this item, because I have been using my poor baby finger to support my phone, and I'm worried that I'm causing permanent changes to my finger in the process. The item looks just as advertised, is comfortable, and sticks on well. However, it will not work with a charging plate. Ever since one of my cellphones had to be discarded after only 2 years of use, due to the port wearing out prematurely, I have been exclusively using a charging plate. So, I simply had to peel the item back off my phone and throw it away. Would have been nice if the advertisement made this clear. I'm giving two stars, because the item is what it says it is. But, that's all, because it ultimately ended up in the trash.
