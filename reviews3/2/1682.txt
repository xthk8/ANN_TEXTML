The touch controls on the side of the buds are extremely sensitive and cannot be fully turned off. Apple side-steps this issue by making all controls stem from very deliberate actions, like double-taps, squeezes, or long taps. With these, however, the most important functions (play/pause & audio mode switching) are controlled by very sensitive single taps. This results in these controls triggering on accident CONSTANTLY. If you adjust them in your ears, the controls trigger. If you’re laying down and you move at all, the controls trigger. I was on my bike and the whipping of the wind on my headphones was causing them to play and pause— I’m not joking.Maybe I’ve got a defective pair, as I start to get a hiss in the left ear when using noise cancelling for more than 60 minutes at a time, but if this is how they’re intended to work, I can’t fathom how this design and functionality was approved.
