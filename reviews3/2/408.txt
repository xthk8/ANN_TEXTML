Worked great for 6 months and then just stopped connecting. Jabra CS and Amazon can't help because it is outside the return window and while it is under warranty Jabra has not been able to troubleshoot or find a solution. I'd love to get my money back but sounds like I'm going to spend another few months trying to get a replacement...
