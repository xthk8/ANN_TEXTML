At first this seemed like a great option. It works with or without using a phone app, is inexpensive, compact and has a great range. However it does not have safety rails, it cut my son's finger the first day as a result.The rear propellers failed to work properly on 2 consecutive units, had to spin them to get them to work on the second unit, first one never worked. Not worth the hassle. Returning this again.
