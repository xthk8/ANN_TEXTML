Honestly i have the non charging one also and have never had an issue but this one I honestly expected more considering the price it does great as a charger it really does but as for a mount no due to the clamp i guess u could call it it doesn’t like staying still and yes i dont have a weird vent it goes on fine but because unlike the non charger one it does have the lip if u wanna call it that or grove it doesn’t hold well at all and considering it is marketed as a charger and vent car mount i expected it to work just fine but im honestly highly highly disappointed definitely for a price tag of 60 bucks….as for the mag safe part its just be fine haven’t had an issue at all with that part of it….if u want a decent car charger with magsafe this is for u but if ur lookin for somthing mount wise as a charger not the best option in my opinion
