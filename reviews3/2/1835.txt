This is now the 3rd Sonos I have bought int he past year or so - all have broken mechanically, with either the speaker fritzing out or the Power Down button failing. Like, I can't even turn them off to try a reboot. And then they work again for a brief period of time after I let the battery run out and recharge.. They have also lost the ability to pair effectively to each other - I can only play one at a time. Frequently when I can connect to them from my IPhone, they show music is playing, but no sound comes out. Maddening..I have not dropped them or spilled liquids etc - they simply fail and fail quickly.Why do I keep buying them? Because when they do work the sound quality is fantastic, perhaps the best on the market for a wireless speaker. It is time for me to try a competitor's product though, I can't believe how quick these things fail..
