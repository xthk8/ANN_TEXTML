A Fantastically Awful Disappointment!. I carefully studied both the reviews and the listing, somewhere at the top of the product description, says 1080P 30 fps and 720P 60 fps. way down at the bottom says, 720P 30 fps. a bit misleading wouldn't you say?. No Stereo sound, using the external microphone! (Picture shows stereo mic), this was the very main reason why I bought this camera. White balance and black level, work like a cheap security camera, no smooth transition, in steps only. kind of fluttery, the pictures color temperature, just all over the place. To manually set and unset the cameras features, is a real pain in the neck.Digital Zoom not smooth, in steps only. Max video quality is kind of similar to that of a fairly decent dash cam. menu settings and set up a very annoying.In other reviews I hear people complaining about the remote not working well. The remote works just fine, just be sure to point the remote in front of the camera, the way you would with a TV set, that is where the infrared sensor is located. the infrared signal from the remote may reflect off of walls and ceiling or even a mirror or two.No Stereo sound at all what so ever. The internal microphone is mono. The external microphone is also mono, left channel analog only. Has a built-in battery to power the preamp. The 3.5mm line out. is an analog signal. On the picture Illustrated, shows an external stereo microphone but it's 100% mono. (Don't forget to turn this on and off). Too bad it's not a stereo mic, it has useful settings. You cannot turn the light on and off while in record or pause mode.I would like to show people a direct recording of this product and others like it at some point in time, so you can hear it and see for yourself.Can support a 128 Gig Miro SD card, using a Micro SD to SD adapter.Each file the camcorder makes will have information about the video and sound quality. Like this below.DSCF0001/Properties/Details.Video: AVI.

Its like having a portable mini DVR, I simply can't believe how old it is now, built in mic audio not so good, but the video part still works way better than this new camera I just bought. Thought it had stereo sound recording. Nope!
