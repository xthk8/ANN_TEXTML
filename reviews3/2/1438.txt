The suction cup doesnâ€™t work at all even in a completely flat surface. The weight of the phone knocks this thing right over. The part that holds the phone seems solid i like that part. I had to dig my previous Walmart holder out of the trash because the suction on that was strong as hell thankfully the ball on the back was the same size so I could swap out the holder and use the Walmart suction holder.
