It gets the job done but i would not use this one again. The width of the base leaves only enough room to hit studs. No room for any adjustment. The base is exactly the size of the holes on the tv so again no room for adjustment. Get one with a wider base so you can move it around and set the tv where you want it and still hit studs. A wider base will also allow you to move the tv the position you want as well.
