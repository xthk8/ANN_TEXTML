They sound great and stay in your ears even when you're running.However after using them only a few times one of them no longer turns off when it's in the case and nothing I do from factory resetting it to removing all the silicone on it gets it to turn off.When it's placed in the case it lights up showing that it is positioned correctly yet it never turns off and eventually kills itself and the case.
