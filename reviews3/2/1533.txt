So cute. However just hours after putting it on my iPhone case, I went out for a walk and it fell apart. It’s totally unacceptable. My old pop socket was still working just fine, but I couldn’t get it off my old case. So I ordered this new one. It’s very cute, but what’s the point if it’s going to fall apart almost instantly? Very disappointed. Now I have this faulty pop socket stuck on a brand new iPhone case and it’s almost impossible to get it off. Between the two my investment was about $22 and I have a nice iPhone case with a pop socket that keeps falling apart. Not sure how to return it when you can’t get it off your phone.
