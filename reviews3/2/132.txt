Obviously, the image of the product is a single box containing 5 cartridges. What came was two boxes (each containing two cartridges) and one pack just on its own (no box). The cartridges are easily damaged, so this is kind of concerning, especially for the price of the film. So far, I've only used the one that wasn't in a box and all of the photos have come out overexposed and/or blurry when they shouldn't have been, or they just havent developed properly. The only reason I didn't return the product is because it's too much of a hassle. After I placed my order, I realized I could have bought double and given some to my friend who also has a camera, but now that I've received it and seen what actually comes I'm not so sure. I'll update my review when I get to the cartridges that were in the boxes.
