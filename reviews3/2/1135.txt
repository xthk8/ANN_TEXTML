The sound was not that great and fell apart with in the second week .. first it was the part that goes against your head fell . Then everything aross the metal band that goes over your head fell off . Noise cancelling well that's not a thing with this head set . And the volume was so low I could not hear anything in it at max volume unless I was stoped with out my semi running . Definitely would not buy again
