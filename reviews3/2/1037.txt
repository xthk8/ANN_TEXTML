It was probably defective, but, this was my experience:It was marginally louder than my phone's built in mic when held 12 inches from the person speaking. It was cleaner with less background noise.Otherwise it was basically useless. Anything more than a foot or two away produced audio that was too low volume to be usable. The mic was even worse when connected to my PC.Yes, I did use the supplied cable, it was connected in the correct fashion with the mic end connected to the mic and the smartphone end connected to the smartphone.I don't think I was expecting too much to be able to use this with a subject speaking from 3-6 feet away from the camera/smartphone. That wasn't something this device was capable of doing. Maybe yours will work fine for you, given the number of good reviews I'm willing to bet mine was just a dud.
