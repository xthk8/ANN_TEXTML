I wanted to upgrade to a 6 ft one since the 3 ft cord I have is starting to break after a year. I was so excited to get the 6 ft one but then found out quickly that it was defective. It wasn't too bad at first but now it's at the point where I have to bend the cord for it to charge. Should've asked for a replacement but then saw that many others got defective ones as well so I didn't even bother.
