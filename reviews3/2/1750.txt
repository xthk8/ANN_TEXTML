As a basic power strip and surge protector, this product is fine.For me, its critical flaw is that the power plug on the strip itself (the one that you plug into a wall socket to feed the power strip) is terribly loose in all the 3-prong receptacles in my house. The funny thing is that my house's receptacles are generally "tight" in the sense that they're all tamper-resistant (as per code requirements) and therefore most things that I plug into our outlets are nice and snug. This is absolutely not snug. It went in, and it "works" but I had to warn my wife "be very careful not to bump this plug because it will come loose." Thankfully the room that it is being used in is protected by an arc fault breaker, but I still don't feel good about using this power strip given that slight sideways pressure on the power cord causes the 3-prong plug to jockey a third or more of the way out of the wall socket.I've generally been quite happy with AmazonBasics products that I've bought. But with respect to this particular product I fear that the manufacturer's quality control is poor. At least it was inexpensive.
