I have bought many products on amazon both good and bad but this is the first time that I've been thoroughly disappointed with the quality of a device that I've received. The device will not focus even after adjusting it incredibly slowly using the focus knob. The picture quality is terrible and anything thats projected isnt readable as its too blurry. The quality of the device is just poor and just cheap.The reason I gave it two stars however is because the company saw an opportunity to pursue a concept that does and can work, unfortunately this didn't execute it in a manner that allowed for a great product to be produced. Also the portability of it is incredible.
