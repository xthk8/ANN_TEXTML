Approaching a reef is a guessing game with this. You cannot combo your sonar with compass like you could with the older legacy 2010C. I like to read sonar, with compass and distance indicator on the screen so I can see direction and distance to my pinpointed wreck location. Instead, they put a silly compass rose over your chart, expecting you to zero in on your reef while the rose and the little boat symbol spins endlessly. It was frustrating finding a reef with all that busy junk on the chart screen. I guess Garmin wants you to buy two of these (one for sonar, and one for compass). While I love the touch screen operation, it is also very "menu deep", basically requiring many clicks per screen or other selection just to get to the screen of your choice. Once you select a few favorites, it's better, but you only have four buttons to save favorites. This unit is a two thumbs down for me, and I'm a lifetime Garmin fan too.
