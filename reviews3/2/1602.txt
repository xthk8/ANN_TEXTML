I am normally pretty cheap. This was my first time buying expensive headphonesThey were good for about 4 months, and then one of the ear buds completely quit working and now I just have so many problems connecting them to my phone. The noise cancellation never worked good for me, it always made an odd humming noise. I didnâ€™t need that feature anyway, listening to music directly in my ear was good enough for noise cancellation. Overall not satisfied, I thought Beats were a good brand.
