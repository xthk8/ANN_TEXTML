So far, it recognizes *only* 2.5" IDE drives. It doesn't recognize my 2.5" SATA drives or 3.5" SATA or IDE. I have about 25 hard drives I'm trying to recover files from, and the 3.5" drives are the most important, but no dice. I've tried everything I can think of--alternate power adapters, alternate USB ports and computers, etc. Nothing solves the problem. I probably won't send it back, holding hope that there's some sort of software solution, but it's back to the drawing board and the online shopping for me.
