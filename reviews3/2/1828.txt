I purchased these units several years ago but only recently began to use them. Much to my disappointment, I found the internal electrical contacts to be of poor quality, often failing to deliver power to cords that a plugged in. Rather, the cords must often be jiggled, with occasional sparking noises evident. I don't know how the design ever managed to get ETL certification -- which was the feature that primarily caused me to choose these units over alternatives.
