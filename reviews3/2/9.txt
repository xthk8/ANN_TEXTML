I had a Brother Printer for years and used it daily, so when it ceased working I went with another Brother Printer. Of course, it can't use the ink I had for the old one, so I donated it to GoodWill. I JUST put in a HIGH YIELD cartridge of Magenta ink. I printed 12 pages and it is EMPTY!!!! Now I can't print anything, even in black and white until I replace it. This stuff is EXPENSIVE and I don't think 12 pages is HIGH YIELD.
