Picked this up on sale for around 5 bucks. I originally purchased to have a black translucent top to pair with my MagSafe base which came with a super cheap clear top. Well this top matches that one. Cheap, unfinished edges and extension cone that scratch my fingers and is easily scratched. Threw this thing in a corner until I needed a base for a clear thin case. Worked fine for that at least. TLDR; get it on sale which I’m sure will happen again for an extra base and give/trade the top with someone who doesn’t notice.
