I'll start with the positive:The fit on these were great. I found them to be super comfortable.I was disappointed in just about everything else. I try to keep in mind that everyone's priorities are different, and I keep price in mind as a determining factor. I got these for $128 over the holiday, which is in line with what I was willing to spend. Immediately, having used Soundcore and Galaxy buds in the last, I found myself firstly disappointed with the limited control customization. I didn't like you had to choose either or. Next I found myself disappointed with the ANC. I could not tell a meaningful difference with it on or off. Lastly, the sound was thin for me. I could not tune it to my liking, and I found the app frustrating to use. I didn't even test multipoint. I packed these up and went back to my Soundcore buds for a better experience for less money.
