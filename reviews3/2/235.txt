The band itself seems very well made and provides at least adequate protection to the watch itself. The slack from a watch band is normally tucked into another loop, and it will hold the excess slack without sliding too much on the band. This watch case/band isn’t able to hold the extra length in the band loop. If I could return the watch band I would, it just wouldn’t be worth my time
