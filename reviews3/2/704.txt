I've been using this stand for 1.5 years by now. It's decent, but the lack of height adjustment makes it very annoying to use whenever I'm in a Zoom or FaceTime call and want to tilk the phone down so my head isn't at the bottom of the screen. I'm a little under 6ft btw. The rubber bits on the stand absolutely SUCK. The 4 bits of rubber that prevents the stand from sliding on your table came off within the first few months. The glue that holds the longer piece of rubber that your phone rests on can warm up easily if your phone gets toasty from a call or charging (not warm but like t o a s t y). This was really annoying because it allows the rubber and glue to be shifted around with your phone and the adhesive would end up on my fingers and my phone. Very annoying. The rubber that your phone sits on is also gone now idk where it is. The metal is sturdy, but I wouldn't recommend it.
