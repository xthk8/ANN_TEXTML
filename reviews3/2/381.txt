Initial setup was easy and audio quality is average. I was expecting better quality in comparison to my headset. I've macbook pro and use an USB-c adapter to connect my monitor & this mic set. For some reason when I connect this mic set, it disconnects by monitor(HDMI). I've to disconnect all and reconnect again to all back. It's very inconvenient and annoying. I wish I could return this product. It's not working for my requirement. My suggestion to buyers is to check compatibility with your setup before buying this equipment.
