I have several issues with these earbuds, firstly the build quality.. I can’t explain it but the case & ear buds feel very flimsy, like of recycled plastic. I’m all for saving the environment. But paying $200 for quality like this. It’s just not worth it for me. Mine were sealed & the case was blemished & has a few scratches which is pretty frustrating. Like I said. I’m all for saving the environment but there’s do‘s and don’t do’s especially when you’re paying for a premium item. Another thing is, they are not loud at all, if you’re listening to older music (90s & below) even at max volume it’s very low. When modern music which is louder still not quite loud and I noticed the right earbud starts distorting and cracking sounds at max volume yet it’s not even that loud? I have some Anker Liberty Pro 3s, that don’t sound as good as these but they are definitely around 30/40% louder and don’t distort. It might be because of their small size? Or maybe the build quality like I mentioned before. Only good thing is that the ANC is very good, I used them for a few hours yesterday while doing some home repairs using loud tools & machinery did extremely well in blocking out most of the sounds. But yeah I will end up returning them and trying out the Momentum 3 Wireless by Sennheiser. I own the Sony M3 earbuds, but I have a feeling the M5 are around the corner, so I decided to buy the Linkbuds S while I wait but I was very disappointed, Sony usually does a lot better than this. Returning them tomorrow. If you have money to blow & don’t feel bothered with just having multiple earbuds go ahead. I do that myself, but these, yeah I’m not keeping these. Do better Sony, very disappointed!
