I wanted a longer Ethernet cable capable of 1Gbps speeds to move my router a few feet. After replacing my existing cable with this one, my speed tests went down to under 100Mbps consistently. I tried everything my router could do but it wouldnâ€™t change. As soon as I put the old cable back on, the speed tests went back up to close to 1Gbps from my provider. Seems like a poorly built cable.
