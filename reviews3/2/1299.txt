First, I will say that the genuine HP cartridges work reliably. I have never had one work improperly, so they seem to have good quality control as far as I can tell.My biggest beef with these things is their lack of value (in my opinion), considering the following:A sizable portion of the ink in the cartridge is used up during the process of pre-printing warmup, alignment pages, test pages, etc. I have noticed that more recent printer models will perform more of these routines automatically- such as printing out an alignment or test page every single time you replace a cartridge. While one could argue that this is for quality control purposes, I liken it to car maintenance people charging you for a front-end alignment every time your tires are rotated... whether you actually need it or not. It's a happy coincidence for HP that all of this pre-print maintenance work uses up even more ink. I'm not the only one that notices this trend either; consumer reporting magazines have singled out HP as a particularly bad offender in that regard: http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/todays-inkjet-printers-give-new-meaning-to-disappearing-ink-070513.htmlYou will have to decide on your own if they are a good value for the money. They do work reliably compared to generic cartridges, but it's hard to shake the bitter taste in your mouth when you find yourself spending this much on ink, knowing that a good chunk of it will never get on the pages thanks to all of this "helpful" pre-printing maintenance that burns up ink.
