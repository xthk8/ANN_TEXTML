As soon as I pulled this out of the box, I had experienced a glimpse of the issues I'm now dealing with. I did not consider returning it because it seemed minor at the time; but now, this cable is practically useless to me. The picture and audio quality is fine, and it will definitely help you out in a pinch. After using the cable for a while, I noticed the signal constantly cutting off if I moved the connection in the slightest. I found myself having to tug the connection and cables to awkward angles just to get the picture to show up on my monitor.If you're trying to save a few bucks by purchasing this cable, I strongly advise against it. You are better off investing in a pricier but higher quality cable or adapter.
