Fantastic at blocking out external noise for listening to music. So I imagine they would be good for someone working in a noisy environment/Motorcycling. They stay securely in my ear right out the box, but I let my SO try them who has really small ears and they did not fit her, even with everything changed over to the smallest size. They still wouldn't stay in her ear.Call quality is not good. It is basically speakerphone quality for the person on the other end of your call. I found I had to talk very loudly for the other person to hear me. They heard everything going on around me which also made it difficult for them to hear me. You basically have to be loudest thing in your environment for it to pick you up. I found myself having to switch the call to my phone and popping one out to have a productive conversation. Everyone I talked to let out a sigh of relief once I was on my actual phone for the remainder of the call.Also because they block out so much external sound, when you're in silence and they are on and in your ear with nothing playing through them, you can hear electronic noises/whirring as you use your phone which was weird.I recently had some very obnoxious neighbors move in to the condo above me, and I usually have to wait for them to go to bed before I can because they are all heel walkers and have galloping children and I actually fell asleep with them in my ears while listening to music. It was surprisingly effective.
