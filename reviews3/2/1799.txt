As soon as I got this I tested it with my Ipad which was at 94%. Usually it would charge to 100% within 5 minutes. Left it on charger, came back 30 minutes later and it was at 98% so it's not like Apple "fast charging" cable :( If you don't mind that it doesn't charge fast it does appear to be very durable since the cable has a thick sheathing.
