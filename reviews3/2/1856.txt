This adapter was touted as being Korean but it is in fact a Chinese article developed back in 2010 and includes a little size CD, luckily I have an old machine that has a CD player but if you don't then it is not much use for backups.The adapter worked straight out of the box although inserting the Molex was difficult but then my Computer decided it needed an update so after the update it did not work !!I suspect that there could be some programme that does not like 2 different versions of windows being connected at the same time, I could be wrong but my collection of old hard drives have Win 98 2 ed, Win 2000, Win XP installed and it was strange that things happened like this and the update was to stop me using this adapter, I could be mistaken though.Apart from that it is a way to access old data once you get the Computer to cooperate but the Molex is fiddly.
