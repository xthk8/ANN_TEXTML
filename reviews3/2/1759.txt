These product photos definitely had me convinced I was getting what I was buying. First, the entire interior of the box is foil-like. A panel slides in to make the back and bottom white, but the sides are still foiled. So no, you can't take photos from "all angles", as the product description says. Also, I made a bad assumption that if they are providing reflective inserts then the whole box will automatically be all white. But no. You have to use an insert, that only covers a limited area. And the inserts don't last long. The first photo shoot and the panels were scratched up within minutes. Can't use this for close-ups anymore. And the height is great, when not using the light defuser. Overall, VERY disappointed with this product. Works great for VERY small and portrait frame shots, not too close. That's about it... Not sure why this is worth $70, other than a bunch of insert options and maybe the light. But not as useful as I thought I was getting.
