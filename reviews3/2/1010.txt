Why so many good reviews? I think you'll get better quality with a phone mic. I used this and it has quite a bit of noise. Maybe it's an upgrade from the camera mic but you should really try just using your smartphone positioned near you, in front of you and try that audioI find that much more usable. Almost passable as studio quality.This mic, however, is far from that. Too much white noise even at close distance with minimal gain. I don't understand the many positive reviews. Honestly thinking people just don't have good ears.Not sure it's possible to get a mic this cheap that's better than your phone mic. I'm using a fantasy s10e. You can get these for like 200 dollars now. Nothing crazy. Much better audio.
