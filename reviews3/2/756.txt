This mount would not stay attached to my vent. No matter how I put it on my RAM 1500 air vent, it would drop the angle of the slats to a downward slope. I tried inserting it just above the slider knob so it would stick in a somewhat vertical position, but even after that, the mount slid off after about 15 minutes of driving.The distance the mount protrudes from the vent, and the weak grip makes for a poor design, in my experience. Maybe better luck with different vent styles.
