The product description claims it fits 26" and 32” TVs, but the brackets are too large for these TVs and are visible above/below the TV when mounted. The brackets were actually the same size as my 32” TV but there was no available alignment of holes to prevent the bars being visible above or below.Get a smaller mount if you have a 26-32" TV
