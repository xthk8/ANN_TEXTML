I would like to preface this review by saying I bought this with the highest of expectations, A High Quality Microphone with a boom stand for not too expensive a price. The Problem with it was that Fresh out of the box the Boom Stand Clamp was Completely Stripped out, It wouldn't tighten up nor hold the arm itself in place. My current solution has been to ditch the arm entirely and use an improvised Stand to hold my Microphone in place. I would ask for a return or send it back, but I know this song and dance already I am not paying for a whole new Boom Stand when I bought one that came with it SPECIFICALLY TO AVOID ANOTHER PURCHACE! If your going to ship something on this website its YOUR responsibility to check for all working parts BEFORE you ship it even if this is a factory or manufacturing error the fact remains That: If I had not Improvised I would be sitting here with a almost $100 mic that had been Reduced to a Brick. The Microphone itself is fine, works good and is very clear, but without a working stand It has been Very Inconvenient to Set Up Safely.
