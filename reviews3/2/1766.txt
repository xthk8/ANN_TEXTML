The light turns itself off just a second or two after being turned on. I have to keep my camera “trigger finger” ready to go the second I turn on the light otherwise I won’t get the shot. Don’t recommend. Also, the light seems bright but the pictures always come out quite dark. Maybe that’s a problem with my photography technique, not sure, but the light turning itself off is definitely a problem.
