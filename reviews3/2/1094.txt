Bought a HP61 Tri Color Cartridge in March 30 since the one in my printer was running low. The old cartridge ran out today May 5, so I installed the new HP61 Tri Color I bought from Amazon. Got error notice from my HP printer that the cartridge was defective. This was the first time ever I had a defective HP product. When I logged on to see if I could get the defective unit replaced I found that After April 20 I could not return the defective unit.Learned my lesson, if you are running low on ink and buy a replacement be aware of the last return date from purchase. It appears that after 3 weeks, I was stuck with a defective cartridge. Should have tried to install the "new" cartridge within 3 weeks of purchase.Caveat Emptor!
