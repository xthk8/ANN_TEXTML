I have bought almost every flagship SoundCore release and appreciate the company's drive to provide excellent audio for affordable prices. unfortunately this headset was the first let down I have experienced .1. noise cancelling - 2/5 its worse than my q20 that came out three years ago2. head band - its too loose and cups your ears less making outside noise seep thruaudio quality was pretty good.
