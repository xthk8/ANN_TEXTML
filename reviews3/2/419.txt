I purchased this headset for use at home both as a work item and online socialization item. My office uses this brand (not same model) and I've been impressed in the past. Not this time.Let's be clear - My audio is crystal clear. I can hear clearly people, movies, and music. And they are comfortable to wear. But that's about all they have going for them.My kitchen is about 30 feet from my desk. If I go into the kitchen for water everyone complains that I sound like a robot, I break up and they can not understand me. The dongle for the headset has no interference between the line to the fridge and it. That is not the 100 ft advertised.Connecting the headset to the computer was not easy. I'm still not sure how repeating the same steps 15 times suddenly worked. In the end it did - so they were not returned. I should have taken it as the warning it was and returned them.For the last 16 months I have have consistent issues with not being able to wander more than 10 feet from my desk without impact, intermittent sound quality, intermittent volume issues, and now they have stopped charging. I can't even wear them as a wired option to keep using them for work until a new set arrives. This holds true when they are connected to my cell phone instead of computer for personal calls, so the consistency of the issue is the headset.Additional, I assumed they would have a mute button, which they do not. I should have researched that item, that is on my, but I felt it should be included for other that need one. *Edit - what I thought was the mute button is the mute button (I pulled the manual) - it never worked and after over a year I assumed I was wrong about it's function rather than another non functioning item.TLDR: I bought these on sale as a trusted brand and have been constantly annoyed for over a year before they broke at 16 months. Not worth the cost on sale, 100% not worth the cost at full price.
