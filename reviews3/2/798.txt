Apparently I have a narrow adult head because the ear cups didn’t hug my ears. You can adjust the ear cups up and down in length, but there’s no way to adjust the width between the ear cups. I do not think someone tried these on and stretched them out because the headphone box was securely shrink wrapped. Disappointed because the Q40 had the features I was looking for. Will have to return.
