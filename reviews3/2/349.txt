Look, if I had a smaller tv this stand would probably have gotten a 4 star review. It comes well packaged and seems like it would be a nice strong base. The instructions are minimal at best, visuals are poor, but we're all used to that and you can figure out assembly easily enough. I really like that they include the tools needed to assemble it, though you need to have a Phillips head screwdriver to finish the installation. They also include a variety of bolts and washers and spacers to mount your tv to the stand...and it probably will work fine if you have a tv less than 65"...the problem for me is they say it will handle tv sizes 22" to 65" and it won't. Mine is 65" and the legs are about an inch too short to work...the base hits the bottom of my set preventing it from being attached at 2 points. To work with this stand the distance from your lowest mounting screw to the bottom of the set needs to be about 6". If it's more than that, forget it, this won't work. the arms are too short.I deducted 2 stars from my rating because they lied about the tv sizes this stand could accomodate (look around and other similar stands sold by other sellers only accept up to 50-55")... and so, because of their misrepresentation, I wasted my time putting it together and then had to disassemble it so I could return it.If your tv is 50" or smaller, this is pretty decent way to stand it up at a reasonable price...anything larger, look elsewhere.
