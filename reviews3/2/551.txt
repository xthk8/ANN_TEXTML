So I looked all over the internet and there’s no acceptable explanation to why Ethernet cables hook into devices with no easy removal process.That said, it got stuck in my brand new Alienware x17 and I got worried my port would break and would be irreparable. Anyway my bf used pliers to gently take it out and we found out the opposite end of the cable goes in and out of the pc fine. But that particular end hooks and doesn’t unhook easily. Got my money back. This was a bad first experience.Sucks though because for gaming? 5 stars. Wifi? 5 stars. But the hook ruined it
