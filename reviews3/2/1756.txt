I've had this product for 11 months and I have had absolutely no problems with it until a week ago when my cell phone fell no more than 2 feet from my bed to the top of the power strip and it completely fried the whole thing. I was only using 3 connections at the time so it really wasn't being over worked but the fact that it couldn't handle the fall of a cellphone can really tell you the quality of the product. You pay for what you get and this is BASIC quality build. Unfortunately I'll have to take my luck on another power strip. Choose wisely, people!
