I have known Sonus speaker products for decades and they were always considered a higher end audio company. I recently purchased the Sonus Move and I am extremely disappointed, especially for the price paid. The sound quality in my opinion is sub-standard with very little lows and too much highs. I have tried continuously to contact Sonus for support and guidance, yet they never responded over the course of a month of trying. The Wi-Fi feature is an excellent idea, except with the Sonus Move, it's extremely difficult to connect. The Sonus App is pretty much useless. Since Sonus never responded to any of my attempts for support, I don't use the App and again I feel like I paid too much money for a surprisingly sub-standard product and useless App. I will be contacting Amazon about a return/exchange for another highly ranked speaker brand and hopefully, that choice will prove to be worth the investment. Product is white, stylish, and makes "noise" that should be considered music, but not with the Sonus Move. If your looking at the Sonus Move, save yourself the disappointment and choose a better quality product.
