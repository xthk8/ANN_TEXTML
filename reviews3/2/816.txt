Beware: although the product description says "8 Widely AC Outlets 3 USB, 6 ft Extension Cord," the cord itself is only about 4 1/2 ft. The wrapped cord also isn't as nice as others I have; it is stretched and warped in places and the bends in the cord from its time being wound up for packaging don't actually come out/relax.
