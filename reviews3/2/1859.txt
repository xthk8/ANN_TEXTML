I have never found a SATA drive that this works on. I'm connected to my Dell laptop with Windows 10. One time for a few seconds I got Disk Management in Windows to recognize a 2 TB Western Digital drive, but it wouldn't let me format or anything. Booted into Linux and I could still see the drive but, again, could do nothing with it. I've tried other random hard drives since purchasing it and have got NONE of them to work. What a waste of money.
