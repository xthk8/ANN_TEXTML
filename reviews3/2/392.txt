These sound good as long as you are right at your computer. The native bluetooth doesn't work even at 3 feet. The dongle works but has a range of less than 10 feet - far less than the stated 100 foot range. I can't fill my water at a sink 13 feet away and in direct line of sight from my desk - the audio sounds like you're talking through a fan. Given the short range, and the price, you would be better off with a corded headset - The range is so short they may as well have a cord.
