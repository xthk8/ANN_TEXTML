Upon first using the earbuds I noticed that when pushed into my ears the sound goes in and out. I figured I just needed to learn how to position them correctly in my ears, but it's always been the same since I received them. They also annoyingly never stay put in my ears. For a product that I planned on using every day at work it becomes time consuming to have to constantly push in my earbuds or catch them before they tumble across the floor. Not that it mattered in the end because the battery lasted 4 hours absolute max. Being that I work around water I need them to stay put so needless to say I only used them for a week, and I thought saving them for home use would be better......THEY'RE MORE OF A HASSEL TO KEEP IN MY EARS AND PROPERLY HEAR BETWEEN PUSHING THE EARBUDS IN! Absolute waste of money, I wish I would've traded them for a different style or anything that would work better. They didn't live up to the Beats name whatsoever......very disappointing.As a sidenote............what noise cancellation?
