I bought this mount for my car because, even though it was expensive, I figured that so many positive reviews meant it was a good product.It’s not awful but it’s definitely not the best. The vent mount doesn’t fit securely and I noticed it had slipped away a little bit at the end of the car ride. Additionally, the magnet doesn’t feel very strong and I’m not confident that my phone wouldn’t go flying if I hit a bump or sudden stop. It’s a very good looking piece of equipment but it seems that they put more into form than function on this one. Maybe it would be better for a significantly lighter phone but I don’t feel like my iPhone 14 Pro is secure on this mount.It’s not the worst mount but I regret spending this much on it. I’ve since purchased an Andobil car phone mount and am very pleased with it.
