Bought it to use with my MacBook, tried it on Google Meetings and the feedback from my colleagues is that it's absolutely useless. The only difference between Mac's original mic and this one is that people hear what they say with this mic. So, you need to use a headphone to have a sound which is not different from MacBook's original microphone.
