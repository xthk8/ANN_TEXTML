"High Volume" cartridges...what a joke. With the cost of paper, it works out to about 8 cents a side with medium setting of just basic text. Close to $150 for two? That's a "Bargain Pak?" Are you effing kidding me? I'm sick of plastic that is NOT re- or down-cycled and just gets dumped in a landfill, likely in another country by the container load. There is just no excuse for the cost of these toner cartridges that DO NOT deliver extra copies, except this is how they make up for selling inexpensive printers. Brother should be ashamed. Check the cost of toner for your model before you buy. Our other 'Brother' has regular toner cartridges that deliver more copies per cartridge at a cheaper cartridge price. It's a total scam.
