No electrical issues but if you plan to mount it with the recessed screw slots on the back then beware... Screws are not included, screw slots appear to be designed for a very specific screw that I was not able to find--requires a very flat head less than 1/16th-in tall and the screw slots are too short to allow the screw to be inserted in the slot anyway. I purchased this because of the vertical plug alignment as well as the gap between plug 5 and 6 which is a great idea, but since I planned to mount it, I was less impressed when it arrived. PS. All mounting dimensions appear to be metric as none of the distances between the mounting holes fell on a standard measurement unit. I was forced to heavily modify their design to enable mounting the power strip on the inside of my cabinet.
