I bought and returned two of these. The first was damaged during shipping, and I thought that explained the poor image quality and consistently out-of-focus on the left. The second lens (undamaged) was the same!While this has a great and usable focal length range, this 5-year old lens has good center sharpness, but anything in the periphery is terrible. It might be OK for portrait photography (ONLY). It is ridiculously bad at shorter focus distances, say 1 meter or less. There, it is utterly unusable. Seriously, I get better pictures from a 10-year old APS-C 50mm prime on my Sony a7 IV. It's really a toss-up to just using clear image zoom on a wider lens.Buy this for its focal range and if you do portrait photography and don't care about anything beyond the center 1/3 of the frame. Otherwise pass. The performance of this lens is just too limited. This lens is in serious need of an update to a G2. At $1400, this lens is a joke. I would look for non-Sony alternatives. Conversely, if Sony redesigns this better, I'd be all over it. Their newer lenses like my 1224GM and P1635G are just unbelievable.
