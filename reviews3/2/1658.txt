More reliable than aftermarket tapes, but still jams and breaks easily. I keep an extra tape on reserve and order a replacement when I start using the current extra tape. The tape I started using in January (purchased in October) jammed and broke in early March. It took about 20 minutes on hold on the Brother support line to find out that the warranty is 90 days and that my broken tape was out of warranty. (I don't know what they would have done for me if I was still within the 90 day warranty.)
