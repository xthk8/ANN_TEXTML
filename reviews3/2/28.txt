I bought this for Valentines day for my wife and my 6 year old daughter so they could bond and have instant pictures. It finally came and I'm disappointed that it comes with a micro USB. When I buy certain products like Samsung, Sony, etc I've come to expect quality for the money I pay, apparently not polaroid. I thought I read through the specs well enough and was like there's no way they'll use a micro USB, and it makes me question the rest of the build quality. Not only did they charge 100$ for tech that two decades ago was 25$, specialized film that costs more than the camera after a few uses but I'm wondering after that USB is trashed if it will even work. I gave it two stars for the benefit of the doubt
