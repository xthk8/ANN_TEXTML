***updating my previous review. It worked great until it didn't 2 months after purchasing it the mic is no longer working! I'll call someone and they can't hear me, if i wiggle the mic around sometimes they can hear me for a second then it disconnects again. Pretty sad cuz i really like this headset.***I drive a cabover truck and it gets SUPER loud in there and when I'm talking on the phone with my wife she can hear me clear as day even years me better than i can hear myself! Does the job 👍🏾
