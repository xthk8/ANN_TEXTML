This expensive name brand ink was sent in a box that looks like it has been opened and restored. Even the cardboard tab has been lost and taped over. I am concerned if this these ink cart have been refilled or are even genuine brother ones. I spent the money for name brand. Was this a returned that was open by someone. When I go to use I will see if they even work.
