You don't need cloud space with this but I have a formatted SD card I tried several different SD cards however This will not record or save any videos or pictures... I can only see live and that's if it's connected which it has a lot of connection issues As well it takes a bit too loud to see and this is only good to look at Live I don't know if mine was defective or what.. I have other cameras I'm guessing related to this because they use the same app however they die Quickly... The video quality is not bad But a lot of times when I go to look at the camera it's just loading or cannot connect which defeats the whole purpose... Along with the issue of not being able to Read any SD cards it has a place for them but But as I said earlier it won't Read them I've tried several different ones different brands I'm just different brands and it doesn't read them I've tried the SD card I had in a camera with the same app as this 1 this 1 that worked great with the other camera it does not work with this one... I meant to return it but By the time I set it up checked it out and got around to it it was Unfortunately 2 days out of the return window
