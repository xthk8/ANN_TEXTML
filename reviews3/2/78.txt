While the price is great (around 180$ on amazon) i am quite disappointed by reading performancesTesting the Card connected to a new reader https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092QSG29S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) to a M1 macbook pro 16", writing speed are not far from declared 800MB/s , but read speed is as low as 240 MB/s while declared at 1785 MB/s (even with the 3.1gen2 Mac port i have to reach somewhere near 1Gbit/s).I tried formatting the card on the mac in both ExFat, HPFS, and APFS (just to benchmark it). I tried to format che card in my X-H2s and situation is always the same.i decided to connect the camera directly to the mac in USB card reader Mode, using a 10Gbit/s cable (tested really fast) and again a 5GB video took around 20seconds to transfer in Photo app, so basically same performances as the reader.while the card can record even 6.2K prores HQ without problems (tested on a fujifilm X-H2s), and i will keep it anyway it seem something is wrong. may be i got a lemon.
