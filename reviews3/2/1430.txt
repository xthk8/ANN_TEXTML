This comes lose quite easyEdit 1 - Support (Letty) reached out Dec 10, 2021 to address my review. A updated replacement model was shipped out and I have received it today. It is currently installed and I will provide an update as soon as I have more data. I will upgrade overall rating from 2 star to 3 star for the excellent support.Here is a summary of how the support conversation went:Support (Letty) - Sent an email apologizing for product's functionality and would like to address any issues. She asked which install option I am using and what car model I haveMe- replied back with I am using the clamp install option along with my car modelSupport - With 1 hour I got a response back with a screen grab of what the vent looks like. The screen grab was from a video off the car's manufacture site. Next came a product idea requesting me to take a look to see if this will workMe - I looked at the product and the description and noticed that the new product has indeed been updated. For those that are curious, new version of the product "should" work with any vehicle. Especially ones that have a deeper air vent. **As a side note, I was kinda of impress at this point as Letty went above and beyond. She also offered to send a updated version.The version is installed and so far looks sturdy enough to hold my phone. Will update once I have a chance to use it more***Stay Tuned!
