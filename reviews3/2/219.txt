they make the image look so much beefier than the actual band - even on sale I wouldn't have paid 25 bucks for this bland piece of rubber that honestly gets caught on more stuff than the watch alone, resulting in a very scratched up screen for me. don't be fooled by images, this is just a rigid piece of rubber, it has none of the definition you see in the image above. and its came green, so naturally I cant find it now to show you a picture. great.
