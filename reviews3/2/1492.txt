These are useless. I was looking for classic wired earphones and these are not.The wire that you connect to the phone is to power them on, then they connect with the bluetooth of the phone. If you turn off your bluetooth these are useless.The only ones that seem to be real wired ones with a decent sound are the original iPhone ones.
