I ordered a phone case that came with this exact pop socket. After about three days of use it snapped in half. Thinking maybe I just got a faulty one I ordered just the pop socket and the same exact thing happened. I really wanted to like this but unfortunately itâ€™s just not worth the money for me. The pattern is cute and the art is high quality but it was just not up to par
