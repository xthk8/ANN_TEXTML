Normally anker products are really reliable, but this last batch were awful, the first cable gave out within the month that I purchased them and the rest aren’t holding up either. They are so bad and it’s so unusual to get such a poor anker product it makes me wonder if I got a counterfeit item. So buyer beware, these may not be the reliable cables you have come to expect from anker.
