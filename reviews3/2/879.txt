Okay, first off, I am giving this product 2 stars cause when they work, they work great. The sound quality is great, so no complaints there. Then the noise cancellation is Superb as well.I’m assuming the battery life is good, as I charge them after every use. They last my entire workout 1-2 hours.Here’s the bad thing, 90% of the time I wear these at the gym, They interfere with somebody else’s Bluetooth. I’m guessing?I’ve switched out my phone, disconnected the Bluetooth and Tried everything I can think of, yet It still happens. For a while, I thought they were possessed because here’s what they do:The sound volume goes up, down, or turns off the song. They do this completely on there own. I can’t begin to tell you how extremely annoying this is when you’re midway through your sets, and you’re really into the rhythm of the music. Note, This does not happen if I’m working out at home, only at my gym. And I’m stuck there looking around and be like “OK, who is paired to my device.”I tell you, every time this happens, I disconnect reconnect and it happens over and over again. I bought a new iPhone recently and the same thing is happening. For that reason, I cannot give these any more than two stars, and I am in the process of looking for another pair of earbuds yet again.
