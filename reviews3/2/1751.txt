Packaging - kudos on plain cardboard box. Improvements that could be made include...mold a support link (I.E. s.az1.pw/B00L3KNY22.html) into the case instead of the environmentally destructive dead tree inside the box. Either way go into more detail on precisely what "wiring faults" trigger the indicator.Trigger the indicator ONLY if there is a fault, not vice-versa. But if you insist on triggering on "good" then use a green or blue led, not amber and certainly not red.Mold in 2 to 4 mounting holes that run the full thickness of the protector so we don't have to use those idiotic slot mounts in the back. I've taken it apart and there's more than enough room and it would in fact be safer as the mount would be much more secure than the friction mount of those idiotic slotted keyways. Either way include mounting screws in the box for those of us without a hardware store next door.If you insist on staying with those idiotic slot mounts at LEAST provide a drilling template on the dead tree or url and as long as I'm highlighting abject stupidity make the center to center on the bolt pattern an even number of inches(or if you MUST mm) and PUBLISH the numbers.
