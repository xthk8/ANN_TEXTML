As mentioned in other reviews, the iPhone will not charge unless you unplug and replug the cable to the magnet pad each time. Might as well get the non charging version and plug in the phone using a typical lightning cable. At least the magnet is super strong and will hold the iPhone pro with a case.Edit: Double checked that my anker power delivery car charger provided 20w and it does. Noticed that if you turn on your car and then attach your phone vs attaching the phone then turning on your car, the wireless charging works more consistently. I expected more from belkin since this is one of my trusted 3rd party brands and first time a belkin product did not perform up to expected standards
