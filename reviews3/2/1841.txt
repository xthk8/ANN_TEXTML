After owning for two Sonos Ones and a Move for 10 months and loving the audio quality, I can't help but change my review to reflect the absolute nightmare that is trying to set up Sonos products. It will either instantly work, or you'll spend a couple hours fighting with it to recognize either the other pieces of the system or the network itself.The problem is with the way the system is designed - it's app based. You buy a speaker, you control it through the app. Yes, you can AirPlay2, but that's connecting to the system, not managing the system. Management can only be done through the app. The app is a nightmare - whomever built it seems to have little UX experience.Example: if you change the network the only way I've found to get your equipment to work is through factory resets. And the set up is never easy; like i mentioned they either connect instantly or take hours. I've learned to try it, if it doesn't work simply walk away and try another day. Yes, setting up a Sonos system can take days.Why would you need to be constantly setting up? Two use cases: either you periodically buy more expensive Sonos equipment to add to your setup, or you move a lot. Either way, setup is horrible.The speakers themselves are amazing. I just wish I could actually use them consistently.
