Thought I was getting a great deal on the ear buds. Worked well while I was inside with my phone next to me. Unsure about noise cancelation. I was inside with nothing else making noise to determine that. Sound was good for the price.However, I bought these for my daily walk. and here's why it was only given 2 stars. Put them in my ears, turned on the music while it was in my hands, close to the buds. Sounded great. I was going to walk downtown to test the noise canceling. Put my phone in my back pocket, as I always do, and started my walk. After about 15 seconds, the music stared fading out or stopping altogether. Figured it may be too far away, the cloudy weather or some other interference, so I put it in my front pants pocket. My ear buds were still fading in and out or completely gone. The only way could get it to work was if it was in my hand at about chest level. What a disappointment it was. I tried a second time in another part of town, but had the same result. So, I continue to listen while in the house with the phone within about a foot away. So I wouldn't recommend these to anyone unless it was for indoor purposes only. And as I said in the title....You Get What You Paid For.
