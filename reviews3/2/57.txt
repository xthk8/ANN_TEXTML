I wanted the cameras for a simple school project. Simple it was NOT. Though the items arrived on time and packaged as stated, the pictures all came out dark, grainy and unusable. Not to mention the fact that next to NO ONE develops these anymore. I had to pay $25 per camera to get it developed. (Not the fault of the seller). I do question how old the film is due to the output. And before it is asked- yes we had plenty of light. Be warned.
