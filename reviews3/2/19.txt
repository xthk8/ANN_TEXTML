What a great, and worthless, camera.Picture quality is outstanding. Saved images are 7680px X 4320px (33MP). The 5X optical zoom is also pretty decent. Night vision is probably amongst the best of the different REOlink cameras I own. This camera also has crisp/clean audio.Why is the camera worthless / stupid? Because positioning of the camera is a manual effort during installation. This is NOT a "PTZ" camera; this is only a "Z" camera under remote-control. You manually use your hand to point the camera in the direction you want during installation... and that's it. So, if you're thinking of using this camera as a wide-angle or narrow-zoom, you will be as sadly disappointed as I am, unless the center-point of your zoomed needs is exactly in the center-point of your wide needs. See my attached photos; wide-angle covers the whole area I was interested in monitoring, but the zoom is completely useless (or, I can make the zoom cover the end of my driveway or dock, but then I'm looking at my soffit/roof in half of the wide-angle video).I should also mention that I was nearly burned by the baseplate temperature while I was doing the installation (yanno, because you have to manually move the camera lens while looking at live video on the phone-App). My camera had been powered (PoE) maybe 2-minutes, while I was installing the 4 mounting-screws, and the baseplate was seriously hotter than I could hold my hand on. I'm betting $117 that this camera will be dead within 12-months.Completely unhappy with this camera, and you will be too, for any application other than maybe monitoring the end of a hallway.
