UPDATE 2/12/23: Power button is not very durable on these. Have two pairs. First pair is a year old, and the power button is hard to turn on and off without it sticking. Second unit is less than a year old, and the button broke completely. Have to turn them on/off with a screwdriver. Wow.I'm wearing them right now. These last forever, like take a beating and keep on ticking, but the biggest regret coming from my Anker Soundcores that broke is the noise cancellation is non-existent. You can hear everything around you, and everyone can hear you. Not good.
