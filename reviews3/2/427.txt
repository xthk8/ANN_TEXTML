I bought this headset in July 2020. It has worked well for me until the last month or so. I needed something with dual connectivity and I liked the charging stand. However, the last month or two, calls get robotic sounding after a few minutes, or crackly from the beginning. If I switch to regular phone while staying on the call, the call is instantly clear and the client can hear me fine again. I believe it's this headset's connection to my phone which is causing this. And of course - the headset is just a few months out of warranty. I spent $160 on this and am frustrated to have to replace it so soon!
