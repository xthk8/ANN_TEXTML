I really wanted to like these. I own Rode Boom mics, Podcast mics, lav mics etc and this one is by far the most difficult to use simply because everything must be done through Rode's proprietary "Rode Central" software. What that means is that you cannot easily transfer files. You can only transfer/download files through their software which is extremely glitchy and works about 65% of the time. You also need to spend $50 on a proprietary iPhone cable just to use it with an iPhone. I have several other sets of wireless mics and this one is by far my biggest headache. I'll definitely be getting rid of them. Sad that Rode would release a terrible product like this.
