I’m a fan of leopard print and especially all black leopard. This pop socket is cool and all, but this product wore out pretty quickly. I’ve had it for about 3 months and it’s so scratched up, you can barely tell what the pattern was. Not only that, but beneath the paint of the leopard print is WHITE plastic. So, when the paint comes off, it’s white underneath. It looks… PRETTY BAD.
