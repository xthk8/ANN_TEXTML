The music sound quality when used with my cell phone is very good, and the noise cancellation seems to work very well too. However, I would not recommend this one if you plan on speaking to other people on the phone. The mic is lousy. Everybody I talk to on the phone says I sound like I'm at the bottom of a well, so I have to turn off these headphones and resume the call on my cell. I no longer use this for telephone calls, hence my 2 star rating.
