I usually have no problem with Brother tapes and I love the brand. However every once in awhile the cartridges are defective and jam.That's what happened with this one. Unfortunately, I bought it a little over a month ago so now it's past the time I can return it.I suggest to anyone that buys a P-Touch cartridge, try it out when you get it so you don't get stuck like I did.
