Super uncomfortable in the ear and the touch controls aren’t intuitive. They also look pretty weird. I didn’t notice anything special about the sound. I ended up just buying gen 1 AirPods from eBay and I’m so glad I did. I meant to return these but I packed them up and completely forgot about them (I guess in a way I wanted to forgot about them lol)- not sure what I’ll do with them now. These are the headphones that you lend to a coworker when they go on a trip, because you don’t know if you’ll ever see the headphones again but you won’t be mad if they do disappear. I guess it would be good for a young kid or some kind of event or whatever where you might lose them. You know, like a cheap pair of sunglasses. These are pretty cheap, and I wouldn’t use them every day as my main headphones. Like I said they are super uncomfortable, the sound is nothing special and the controls aren’t great. Plus I had a lot of trouble where only one would work with my iPhone and the other one would just drop out randomly.
