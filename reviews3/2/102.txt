It comes with NO instructions. That said, connecting it was easy - it seemed to auto pair with my phone. Still something that lets you know what the device name is would be really helpful, since the name is somewhat cryptic. It is not clear how to answer a call - again no instructions. I would have kept it even with it's short comings, but with the volume turned up as loud as possible, it was still too low to hear well in the car. I am really disappointed because I needed something that will work and had to go back to ear buds until I find a better solution. My advice is don't waste your time on this.
