Nowhere on the package has Brother International Corp., provided the information that this is a Matte or Dull finish of lamination. Take a look at the photo of the clear package shown on Amazon. Packaging is now mostly cardboard and it doesn't even have that information either. Had I known that before purchasing it, I never would have bought it. Also, white print, even if it is large, just doesn't show up well. It isn't sharp like black ink. That said, we do use a lot of white on clear tape [TZe135] in 1/2"/12 mm & 3/4"/18 mm [TZe145] . (clear isn't available in less than 1/2"/12 mm). The white on clear is sharp compared to the white on Lime Green Tape [TZeMQG35]. The same problem exists with the Berry Pink tape [TZeMQP35].
