these mics work great! unfortunately one of the transmitters I received is defective and has a buzzing noise when using a lavalier mic. I'm certain it is not the lavalier mic because it works perfectly fine with the other transmitter I received. the transmitter is completely useless as the audio has a constant, annoying buzzing in the audio clips. I would do a amazon return to get them replaced but I need the one mic that works for filming every weekend so it's hard to find time to do that without being delayed.
