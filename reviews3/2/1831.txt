This is a product from Korea and does not have the Underwriting Laboratories listing (UL). I plugged in a sub-woofer and immediately got a humming (not from the sub-woofer) that is immediately recognizable as due to improper or inadequate grounding. So not only is this not usable for my purpose, but a potential hazard.
