I purchased (2) HP 61xl back in April & Del on April 27.I bought a new HP Printer & waited awhile to connect it because I don't now how to connect them or set it up.So I had to wait until my son came down from Pa. to NJ. to connect it for me.So when we finally set it up on 6/10/16 we put in the New Ink I bought from you & its telling me Ink Is Low less then 1/2 of course.So I'm thinking these inks I purchased are too old.Today is 6/15/16 & the 1st Pkg. is empty & already have to open the other & I think this is wrong.I usually get 3 to 6 months out of XL's This didn't even last 2 wks.
