The noise cancellation was good. The sound quality was disappointing to say the least. Something I was looking forward to in a BEATS product but definitely fell short of it. Battery life isnâ€™t 8hrs, more like 3hrs. Overall, I would probably spend the extra $ to get something that will perform at the high quality level expected from BEATS product's.
