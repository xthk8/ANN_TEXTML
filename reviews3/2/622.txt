I’ve had it for 30 days. When it worked, it was comfortable with good bass response. It pairs fine with my iPhone, but failed to pair with my Windows 11 laptop. I’ve never had a previous problem pairing a Bluetooth device with this laptop.The showstopper is it stopped charging. The same cable charges another manufacturer’s headset with no problem. I’m sending it back.
