I've had this camera for about a month and a half and I've taken a handful of pictures with it - 2 in natural light and 4 in dimmer rooms . The natural light pictures are leagues above the dim rooms (which is to be expected) but I just can't stand the quality of the pictures. I'm not sure if it's user error but all of my photos have come out blurry/fuzzy (though I'm not sure what I could do to fix this since there's no manual focusing outside of regular mode and selfie mode). There was one picture I took in my room with the lights on (its the one on the far right in the picture) and the flash went off which made the picture come out extremely dark for some reason and was just a waste of film. I've experimented with trying to cover the flash since it's automatic depending on the lighting and that didn't produce good results at all so youre stuck with the camera deciding when it needs flash unfortunately. Overall, I think the camera itself is adorable and the pictures can be cute when taken in natural light, but for the amount of money you're paying, I would recommend looking at other cameras.
