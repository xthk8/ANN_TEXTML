I have not used this cartridge yet, but I think it's important to point out to others that the cartridge I received was NOT packaged in the HP box as shown in the picture. It arrived in a bubble-wrap sealed envelope. Because the HP box was not included, there is no way of knowing how old the cartridge is or what the expiration date is. A card was included in the package indicating that if you prefer the retail box, they would ship it separately. How would I know that the box they ship to me would be the original box that packaged my particular cartridge??? I would not recommend purchasing this cartridge and will not again purchase from this seller. Shame on Amazon for including this as a Prime item! I'm rating as high as two star only because I haven't inserted the cartridge yet and am hopeful that it will actually work adequately when I do.
