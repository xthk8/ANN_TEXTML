my phone is currently plugged in to one of these bad boys and it is not charging because i picked it up to type this review. all it takes is one tiny bump and the thing comes disconnected. i thought maybe i received a bad batch, so returned the first bunch. nope, they just suck. forget about using them in the car! other chargers work fine with my device. so, they work when you have them perfectly aligned and absolutely no pressure on the cable from it sagging or any slight disturbance from vibration. forget about using your phone while itâ€™s plugged in.
