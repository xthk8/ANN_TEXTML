Sound cancellation barely works, I don’t hear any difference when it’s on or off. I definitely can’t use these while I’m mowing (gas powered mower). Not really comfortable to wear and I need to take them off after about an hour. Poor quality of materials - these won’t last more than a year. Sorry to say this, but they’re just a typical Chinese product. They’re ok for a cheap pair of headphones, Do NOT buy if you’re looking for high-fidelity, long lasting, daily use.
