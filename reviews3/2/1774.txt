May return. The back of the box shows another bracket for a tablet but the description & images don't.DOES NOT FIT 6.5 IN DEVICE!Description says it fits 3.5-6.5 in device. Barely fits a 3.5 (see pic for inch marks fully extended.)Looks like they started including a bottom pad to keep it from wobbling. It is veeeerrrry soft so it would be good to have it on a flat, smooth surface. You can see the indentation from just a few mins resting on a bolt.
