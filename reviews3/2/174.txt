This was my Christmas gift after I fell and broke my SX60HS on a hike. The image quality of the SX70 was both, in my opinion, somewhat grainy and fuzzy. The focus boxes seemed to always skew to the right/left and not in the center. I am a point and shoot user with the camera always on auto (or portrait for closeups...flowers, etc.). The portrait pictures using the SX70 were excellent just like the SX60, but the pictures (w/ or w/o zoom) on "auto", I believe, lacked the SX60 sharpness and clarity by a long shot. I felt the camera was defective so I returned it on the 30th day which Amazon qualified with their return label etc. I was happy until I saw the re-stocking fee Amazon charged me. I need my SX60 back, I would buy buy another SX70 IF it demonstrated the SX60 quality I experienced before.
