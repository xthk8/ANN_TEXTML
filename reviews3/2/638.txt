If the position of the ball socket notch was positioned differently, the tripod wouldn't fall over when a cell phone is attached. The notch is where there are two legs, so when the weight of the phone is added, it becomes unbalanced and falls over. I tried to use it on vacation to take photos when someone else wasn't able to take pics of my family as well as during long exposures for nighttime shots. Unfortunately I was not able to use this on vacation for that reason and now it's past the return window, so I'm stuck.
