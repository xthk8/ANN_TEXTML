Honestly, I wanted a carplay radio that would have decent output for my new speakers. This is not the stereo for that. Pretty easy to install, we bought a standard adapter for the car and wired the two together. Upon first listen, it completely WIPED the bass from my 450W rear speakers. The radio, bluetooth and carplay had significantly different volume levels. Carplay was practically unusable because of the distortion in the sound. It works if you want carplay and donâ€™t care about sound quality. Definitely not for me so I uninstalled and will be returning.
