These are very small, comfy earbuds. They’re great for those of us who sleep with earbuds in. Otherwise, I don’t see much to recommend in these.I’m a big fan of most things Sony. I bought the controversial LinkBuds when they came out, and I love them. However they serve a purpose; I can listen to my podcasts and music and still hear everything around me. They have a quirky fit and inferior sound, but they are extremely useful. I was hoping for a similar experience with these, and was disappointed. These are $200 earbuds that don’t do anything particularly well. The transparency mode, which I would use these for, is far inferior to the natural sound let through on the original link buds. The noise cancelling also falls well short of the XM4s and most other models at this price point. I found the sound quality to also be severely lacking. In short, I don’t understand the reason for this release. Get the original LinkBuds if you want a great pair that lets you stay aware of your surroundings all the time. If you just want earbuds for decent sound quality and noise cancelling, pay up for the XM4s or look at another, better pair at this price point. I would highly recommend the Sennhesier Momentum 2, which are around this price now with the release of the Momentum 3s, and do everything better. Sorry Sony!
