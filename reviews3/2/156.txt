Works great until I try to upload the footage to the GoPro Quick app. I have been trying for 5 day. One hour of footage everyday and when I click scan for footage it says no new footage found. My firmware is up to date and I have removed and added the camera multiple times.Also the battery last for 35 to 60 mins.Also was a headache downloading because it would take so long to download. My battery would run out before I could download My footage to the app. NOW I CAN'T EVEN DOWNLOAD ANY THING.
