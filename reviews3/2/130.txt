I ordered multi pack ink toner when I received notice printer was running low. I just replaced the magenta toner cartridge and the printer does not recognize it as a Brother Cartridge. So I had to go purchase another magenta cartridge. I haven't had to replace the others. I hope I don't have trouble with those cartridges. But now I'm out $78 since I had to purchase another cartridge from Office Depot.
