The cards recorded the pictures, but I could not get a prograde or sony card reader to download them to adobe bridge. I'm using a Canon r5 camera, windows 10 on two different computers, and the latest version of adobe. I spent time with adobe, prograde, canon, and sandisk trying to get these to work properly.
