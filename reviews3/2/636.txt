Bought this tripod to hold a 4" PC fan with speed controller to suck my solder fumes out of my face when soldering. When I got the unit I noticed the clamp wouldn't spring back or rebound. I opened and closed the things numerous times with much effort and it's like the clamp is binding inside. I can make it hold my 4" fan but it isn't clamped onto the fan like it should be.So I contact the seller and ask for a "clamp" replacement. The agree and they end up sending me a clamp with one threaded mounting point instead of the two like the original. The clamp is also a lesser quality clamp and, best of all, it won't hold a 4" fan. The only reason I purchased this "kit" is because of the ability of the clamp to open up so wide. I haven't even had a chance to use the tripod to leave a review on it since I'm still battling the clamp.
