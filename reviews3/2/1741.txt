I really wanted to love these but I could not. They are advertised as 200m range line of site. Perhaps this is under ideal conditions. We tested at about 20 feet and every time we moved a lot or had our backs to the camera the audio was staticky or interrupted entirely. This would mean we would have to pull the local audio off the mic and combine it with the video for almost every shot. In the end it is not worth the effort. perhaps these are great for people who need a wireless mic but stay very close to the camera and do not move around? great concept but prone to drop offs and static. will be returning them.
