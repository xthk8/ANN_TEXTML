Quantity was not twenty items. Arrived in a heavy box like shipping envelope.Twelve ferrite items in a freezer bag. Five others were tossed loosely into the shipping container as if sewn to make up for a visible shortage. Brought the total to sixteen items not twenty.Three of the larger diameter were open, the rest were all snapped shut. They are difficult to open if you don't have instructions (There are none) or learn the secret.I managed to get three of the size I needed to open and tossed the rest in my electronic junk drawer.They closed snugly around to two audio cables on my Blue Yeti Pro Microphone and seemed to have eliminated the annoying high frequency transient overload that would paralyze my Blue and send my computer in a search of a different audio driver and device.So, I cant really judge them other than the two that I used seemed to work OK so they must be of decent ceramic composition.They are probably a decent product and I would have been happy if there had been the twenty as advertised. Maybe pieces means to count the portions that are open, Who knows. No instructions, poor package control. Had these not had so many shortcomings I could possibly have rated them much higher.I thought I was buying new merchandise. Too much hassle to return or take the time to call.Just grin and bear it, live and learn.
