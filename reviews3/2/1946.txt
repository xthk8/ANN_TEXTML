On paper and in ad picture, the AirTag holder looks durable. In reality, the clip is easily opened. I lost my AirTag without knowing it until I happened to see the clip part laying on the ground in a large department store. I retraced my steps, playing the FindMy alert and could never find the tag. $30 down the drain for AirTag and holder. So disappointing.
