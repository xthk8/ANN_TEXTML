I loved the look of the bee on my pop socket. Thatâ€™s why I bought it. Had I known it would fall off in between my fingers while holding my phone I would not have bought it. Very disappointing. Also very disappointing and pop sockets warranty. Did you know you have to send the product back to them and pay for them to send you a new one if they decide that it was their fault? So sad. What a waste of $10. ðŸ¥²
