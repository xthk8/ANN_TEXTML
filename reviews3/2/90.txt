I’ve been using this camera for about a month and I really like this camera a lot….but I have to always reset the flash every time. It’s honestly so annoying because having to stop and reset and rotate to the flash button when I just want to take pictures is time consuming. I just wish that I was able to use the flash function without having to rotate each time around the lens. It’s amazing for day time and I love all the pics I’ve received but during the night it’s just a hassle to have to stop and have people wait so I can turn the flash on once again. I thought this was just the function of the camera but it seems like I just got a faulty one unfortunately. I do love the half frame and ability to take more photos, I’m just bummed because I mainly take photos at night.
