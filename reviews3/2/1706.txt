Although they fit great. The left earbud hardly charges accurately in the case if any. I did see another review about having issues with the left earbud as well but i gave it the benefitof the doubt. Sometimes they had trouble connecting and phone calls you could hear an echo or the other person on the call had trouble hearing you. I ended up returning them unfortunately.
