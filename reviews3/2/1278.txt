I wasn't really happy with this wireless headset due to the number of times it dropped calls and the amount of static in the headset. I moved it around to keep it away from other power supplies, monitors etc., but it still didn't work that well. Combined with the number of times it dropped calls it made it unusable.I've had great luck with Plantronics headsets over the years so I was really surprised and disappointed with the quality of this one. I can't recommend it in good faith. I gave it two stars because I think it might work fine in a solopreneur office or a single office phone use but I'm not completely confident of that. Also be careful, the range is severely limited by walls so if you have into an office with several walls between the base and the headset quality degrades to nil quickly.
