I originally purchased this headset in August 2020 and today it broke (Sept 2022, 2 years). I just want to echo what other reviewers have mentioned, and that’s the fact that the earphone pieces break off because they’re held on by a very very small piece of plastic at the joint. For the price, I would have expected better quality. Additionally, the charging cord it came with frayed at the end and I had to replace that. That wasn’t a huge deal, but today the ear piece breaking off makes them unusable. I’m off to find a different and better headset.This was my second Jabra set (first was provided by work, also broke and I purchased the second myself — obviously a mistake!). Never again. For what it’s worth, I take care of my things, too, so it wasn’t like I was abusing the headset or careless with it. Save yourself the trouble and look for a different set.
