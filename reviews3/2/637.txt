This tripod is not a great design. Anytime I put my phone in the holder, the tripod tips. It is the most frustrating piece of equipment I have ever attempted to use. It is awful and not user friendly. Adjustments are difficult and cumbersome. I had to attach weights to the legs to offset the weight of my phone. Forget attaching a light because there is no way to do it easily. I despise this tripod and it is not a good design.
