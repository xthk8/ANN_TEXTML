Tried this product at home in a quiet setting and I thought I would be good until it came to using it in the actual workplace a few weeks later. My truck doesn’t even make that much noise but It definitely overwhelms the sound from the headset to the point where I can’t hear who I’m speaking to. Tried playing with the settings on my phone and on the headset but no help.I ordered this a few weeks before I got to actually try it in the workplace and now my return window has closed for a return.
