It sets up really easy and packs up nice.After a few uses the light settings don't work anymore. I have two settings .... on & off.The filter doesn't sit right and falls off the velcro.Seriously I can live with all of the above.I bought this to photograph jewelry. The lights reflect a round glare that does not flatter the jewelry I'm trying to photograph. So disappointing.For me this was a waste of money.
