After using it for about 6 months, the microphone plug wouldn't work. I had to use a rubber band to get it in the exact right place for my microphone to transmit audio. After about 2 more months of using the rubber band, the microphone plug needed even more pressure on it to transmit audio.I swapped to an audio jack from another company and have been having no problems since.
