MD might want to rework their QA process because the top bar of the bracket that mounts to the wall wasn't level in any way. Additionally the arms that go on the rear of the TV were not square. When mounting a large TV any errors in tolerance are amplified and noticeable. It took me quite a bit of time to figure out how to compensate for all of the quality issues but I managed to do it.I will say for $15 bucks its sturdy. I usually purchase from MonoPrice and will likely go back to them as I haven't had issues with them in the past.
