It says you can hit the power button for the noise canceling feature. It does not work. Also you can not just plug the headphones in and listen like normal headphones. You have to turn the headphones on to listen to it, and once the battery dies, even though it's plugged in and no Bluetooth being used, it still dies and then you have to recharge it in order to continue to listen to your music. It's so dumb.
