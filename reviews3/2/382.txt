I purchased this mic after doing a TON of research and reading countless positive reviews, but noticed almost immediately that my microphone didn't sound anything like what I heard from other users. I have a background in production audio so I understand how to remove noise, add EQ, and otherwise clean up audio in post production, but that wasn't the problem. The real problem was that they started using a new processor chip in this microphone (supply chain issues due to Covid?) and that causes a great deal of distortion when you speak directly into the mic, even at a recommended distance of 7-10 inches. Any time my voice modulates even in the slightest, the audio becomes distorted and that's not something you can clean up.Long story short, most of the reviews on YouTube are referencing the mic that went into production in 2019 through mid-2020. Then they started using a new chip and that chip causes distortion in your vocals.I'm going to return this and reach out to Maono to see if they can replace the mic with an older version, or upgrade me at no charge. Wish me luck.
