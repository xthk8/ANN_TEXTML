The mic splitter only worked with my Panasonic earphones. The mic did not work with the earphones that came with my Samsung Galaxy phone or the one that came with my iPhone. The sound will come through fine on all three earphones but the mic only worked with the Panasonic. While testing with the Discord mic check feature, the Samsung and Apple earphones only produced a static noise from the mic.
