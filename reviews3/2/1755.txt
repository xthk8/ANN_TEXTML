I expect the vast majority of the good reviews of this product are based on the price point. Since this SPD will allow voltage spikes up to 800V before clamping, it is basically a glorified power strip. The external materials seem good enough, but I would prefer a shorter cord. If you have sensitive equipment, don't skimp out on the surge protection. Make sure to check the clamping voltages, and if available, the response time. (Joule ratings have more to do with the longevity of the SPD than the level of protection.)
