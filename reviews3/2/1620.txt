Bought this tape and it fit my old printer OK and it says (Amazon) it will fit the PT-D600 printer. So I ordered the PT-D600 printer, because I wanted some labels with a font from my computer, and I wanted black tape with white letters. Even though the label said the tape was an TZe and it would fit the PT-D600, nope won't fit. These a small plastic pin in the upper right hand corner that is suppose to go into a hole in the upper right corner of the cassette. That hole isn't there. So while this will fit the old printer, it doesn't have the plastic pin, it WILL NOT work in the PT-D600 printer. I needed some labels from the new printer, so I drilled the hole there, now the cassette fits, but I'm not doing this for every cassette I purchase from Amazon, or anywhere else for that matter. Was disappointed in the misleading description, and see it's still there. Labels appear to be the same quality as all the other colors I've used, just the cassette case isn't compatible...
