On the Amazon website, these headphones looked like they were high-quality.However, when I opened the box and picked them up, I was immediately dissapointed.They felt like cheap plastic and looked like they should cost no more than $19.More importantly the sound quality and bass were mediocre at best.I have a few pair of $20 to $25 wireless Bluetooth earbuds (from Amazon) with sound quality and bass they is 5x to 10x better than these headphones. You'd think quality sound and bass would be more easily achieved and experienced in big headphones; however, not these.I'll be returning these because they are a total disappointment (and way overpriced for such mediocrity).
