After my original Apple charger cables frayed and stopped working, I researched new iPhone charger cables for a long while, and didn't want to buy Apple again because they are quite expensive. My wife had another Anker product that she really liked, and even though these were a bit more expensive than some other options, they looked well made. So far, the cords themselves are very resilient and sturdy, but the charging end comes unplugged from the phone at the slightest movement, even if the cord itself moves. I have an iPhone 8 and my wife has a new SE, and it's the same problem for both phones. Many mornings I have woken up to a dead phone that was supposed to be charging all night. Now I know why you have to pay the extra money to buy Apple cables - because everything else will simply not work as well (and Apple knows it!). I really want to like these cables, but they are not reliable at their primary function.
