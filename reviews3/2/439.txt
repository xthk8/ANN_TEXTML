The product is pretty simple, but the material already started to fray when i stretched it out. I can tell the materials are cheap and will not last. I don't like how much the adjustment piece bulges out and makes the watch uncomfortable as you're typing or resting on a keyboard. The material is also thicker which is not a preference of mine. Overall it will do the job, but not the best.
