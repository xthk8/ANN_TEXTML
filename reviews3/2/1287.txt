I have had this product a little over a month and although I was pleased with it at first, last week it started to have issues. I use this for work and haven't done anything different to it when the audio started to have problems. I can hear people but they can't hear me. I've had a Tech look at it and it's very obviously a defect in the product I was sold. I wanted to return it the day it happened (last Thursday) but it shows the refund deadline was Sep. 30th. I've contacted the product support team and Amazon but have had no resolution. The warranty on the product ended in January according to Plantronics so the seller must have had it over a year. Very disappointed because this item is not cheap.
