I think it’s nice to be able to purchase a product that is affordable for those who cannot splurge on an apple product. At first this headphones were so great, I really had a good time using them, I like the different sizes for the ear pieces, so they fit comfortably in my ear as I listened to my music. I think after the first few times I used them they stopped pairing at the same time. One ear piece would playing music but the other one won’t play any music at all and they’re both connected with the Bluetooth which is pretty confusing. I tried forgetting the device I several times but only one at a time will the pieces play my music. Kind of disappointing.
