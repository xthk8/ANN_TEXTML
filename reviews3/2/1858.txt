I have been searching for a long while for an adapter that would work with the 18tb western digital ultrastar dc hc550 hard drive. While this adapter does let the computer recognize the hard drive, it took about 6 minutes to download 5 pictures to it. Too slow to be usable. It probably does work well with the smaller drives but if you need an adapter for a large Enterprise drives look for: Vantec NexStar HX, 3.5" SATA III Hard Drive Enclosure USB 3.0 with Fan (NST-387S3-BK).
