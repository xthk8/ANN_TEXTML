a few things, 9 feet does not go very far. I used medium font and was able to get about 40 labels. It defaults to put an inch between each label so you'll need to figure out how to reduce the wasted tape between labels.Labels iron on but do not stick well. Maybe stitch them on in addition to ironing.The text smeared a little during ironing - be sure to let the labels rest for a while before use.Quality looks pretty cheap, but hey I guess that's the point. Would be fine for personal use. Not good for business use.
