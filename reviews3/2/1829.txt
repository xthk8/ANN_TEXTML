One of my two power strips functions okay. The other power strip doesn't function AT ALL and is a hazard. It was so poorly made that you can't even insert a plug halfway into the outlet. I could get a plug into only one of the outlets but had to use extreme force. I can even visibly see an internal metal piece that was misaligned probably causing the issue. I reached out to the company asking if they can reimburse me for one or at least send me a new one and have had no response in ten days... Not worth the price or time spent.
