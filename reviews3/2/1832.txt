I've ordered multiple power strips from this manufacturer. Most have been fine, but today I had one that was bad "out of the box". The light lit up but the actual outlets didn't work. I tried various scenarios to confirm that the issue was with the power strip and not anything that I was plugging into it. Personally, I'll avoid this brand in the future because of it.
