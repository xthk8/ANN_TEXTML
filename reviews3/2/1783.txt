This stand is very sturdy with a large, weighted base and fully adjustable arm that allows you to position your phone at any angle, which is very convenient; very handy if you need your phone to sit up a bit higher when cooking and reading a recipe at the same time. The first thing I noticed was that the stand needed an adjustment so the base wouldn't spin round and round without actually tightening. Maybe it was just the one I got. While it holds your phone securely, the rubber strips inside the clamp that actually holds the phone started peeling off within days. I thought, oh well, just glue them back on, but again, they began slipping off within another few days. This really became annoying. I'm considering removing the rubber strips altogether but then I would be stuck with just the plastic clamp with sticky residue holding my phone. Not great.
