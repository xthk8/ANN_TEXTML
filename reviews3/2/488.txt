I have purchased these 3 times over the last year. I am a teacher so my home laminator gets a workout. They used to be so thick and awesome but this last box I got, most of them stuck together and we very flimsy by the time I was able to separate them. I found this out, of course, way past the return time limit. Pretty bummed. Might need to find a new brand to try.
