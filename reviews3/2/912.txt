Alright, if you’re looking for a detailed & honest review, this is for you.Sound quality: I’ll give it a 4 out of 5. For the price of this ear buds, the sound quality is superb & with a really decent noise cancellationBattery life: I’m giving it a 5 out of 5. It lasts as long as any other high quality eat bud out there.Here comes the part that made me give it a 2 out of 5 overallConnectivity: Easily one of the worst earbuds I’ve used in terms of connectivity.Where do I start??If you put your phone in your pocket while listening to music, forget about it. It gets super staticky. So, if you’re a runner and you expect to have your phone in your pants/shorts while you run, forget about it. This earbuds are pretty uselessWhen you take it out the charger case and put it in your ears, there’s a really high chance one of the buds wouldn’t sync and you’ll have to do it all over again till it syncsI hope this helps anyone trying to decide if this is a good buy for them.
