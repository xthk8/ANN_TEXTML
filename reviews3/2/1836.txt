I bought this speaker after doing a lot of research. I own other Sonos products and love them. This speaker however didn't measure up in almost every way. The syncing with Bluetooth seemed needlessly difficult and unlike almost every other device I have used. But once this is accomplished, the main issue becomes clear. The battery life is horrible. Part of the reason I bought this was my experience with other products made by Sonos. I assumed this would be a big step up from the other "portable" speakers I have used. It sounds good, but not for the large price difference compared to most other speakers. But back to the battery life, maybe I just got a lemon. I haven't read much about battery issues with this speaker. Fortunately, I never took it away from my house. It simply holds very little of its charge. Had I actually taken it somewhere that I needed to rely on just the battery, it would have been even more disappointing. Perhaps this is my fault in a way as I assumed the speaker would have a larger battery given how big it is. Either way, portability is really not an option. I do love Sonos and I won't let this deter me from soundbars and other speakers made by them. It simply may have been unique to my speaker. The Bluetooth could work better though and that is mainly a software issue. If you plan to be around an outlet and don't want to travel with the speaker, you will probably be pretty satisfied. It does sound good. It is just important to temper expectations.
