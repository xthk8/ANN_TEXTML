I purchased these in November, and primarily use them to put in suitcases when we travel, and back pack. Product appears very well made. Leather and stitching suggest a higher quality product - as does the actual key ring, which has a hinged section making it easy to attach. However, the hinged section on one of my key chain holders failed and broke off. I don't use these often, so I can't comment on the overall long-term durability. I've tried to contact the company, but can't seem to find any contact information for them.
