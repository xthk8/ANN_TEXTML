I've had this for a while, and I am starting to not like it. It works when it wants. It missed filming important events at my outside door on multiple occasions.Cameras freeze on a random basis and have to be reinstalled to the system. Same story with the Sync module. There are fake alerts coming from my basement and bedroom cameras all the time - when there is no movement whatsoever. The quality of the video leaves a lot to be desired. Especially at night, when faces 10 ft away are completely unrecognizable. The system is extremely sluggish. When it detects a movement, it takes forever to stream the video on your phone. By then, whatever happened, happened.I was initially super excited about it and even recommended it to my girlfriend. Less than 2 weeks after using her system, she ran into the same issues as me. I had to reinstall everything at her house to make it work again.I gave it 2 stars, not 1, because it's inexpensive, and the idea behind it is really really good, but when it comes to quality and reliability, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
