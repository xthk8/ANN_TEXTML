When these worked, they were okay but almost every other one I tried curled at the end that feeds into the machine. Also, they would reverse back into the machine before completing the page. Lastly, they are extremely staticky but don’t seem to “hold” items in place as I feed it into the machine. I have the scotch laminator and have never had this problem before. I usually order the scotch brand or amazon basics and will go back to those from now on. The couple bucks I saved on these weren’t worth the frustration or time wasted on having to print some materials again because the first one was ruined by crap lamination. I laminate WAY too many things as a teacher to deal with the hassle.Had to add that I continued trying to make these work and it started causing my laminator to roll the whole thing around the rollers inside the machine. Again, have had my scotch for years and NEVER had anything like this happen.
