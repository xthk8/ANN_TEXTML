I like how portable this is and how well it automatically adjusts the focus and keystone. Some of the reviews I read said that feature didn’t work well but it has been fine for me and don’t even have to think about it.The idea that this is a 500 liken projector is funny though. The only scenario I could actually use it is in a sealed room with no ambient light whatsoever. Even a closet I tested it in had a red light from the smoke detector that interferes with the picture. I bought this to use as a ceiling projector in a dim room but it is so washed out you would never notice the picture was there.I would only recommend this device to people who need a small portable monitor they can project on the wall in a dim room. If you have the projector facing squarely against a wall from within 1-2 feet you will be able to see the colors clearly, but then again the image is just going to be 16-20” in diameter so keep that in mind.I have a projector screen I tried projecting this onto from 7 feet away and measured 98 Lumens at the screen.
