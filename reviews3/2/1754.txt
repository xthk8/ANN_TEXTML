The Power-Strip “works” well enough, but the Vertical Receptacle Slots, for any Plug’s Prongs, are too large and wide. Plugs “plugged” into the Power-Strip become unplugged/dislodged from the Power-Strip, (both constantly, and much too easily), due to the “loose” fit of any/all plug’s prongs into the Power-Strip’s. My devices are constantly unplugged. It is very frustrating. I am well outside the return window. The Power-Strips still look “new”, but nonetheless, I am currently searching for two new Power-Strips to replace these so my devices will “stay” plugged in.
