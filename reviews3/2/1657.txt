I was outside the return window when I needed to reload my faithful Brother P-touch PT-D200 Label Maker so I'm stuck. But here's the scoop:Faithful P-touch produced labels until yesterday. Today it exhausted the current cartridge. I installed the new "black on white" cartridges (1 of 2 I bought), entered the info to print, pressed print and the P-touch shut down. Removed and reinstalled, everything's normal, label info shows but press print and P-touch dies. Check all connections, try again. P-touch dies. It's an immediate need so I tried the "black on clear" cartridge that I used 36 hours ago. Apparently the print function is now in permanent kill mode because even yesterdays tape won't work.If it doesn't kill your label maker take note: This product does not have a split back. It will be EXTREMELY difficult to peel the label from the backer.I've been a loyal P-touch user for years and bought them for home office and office. But now I'm on my way to the office supply store to find and buy another brand of label maker and a supply of tape.
