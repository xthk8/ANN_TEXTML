I bought this a year ago for my Tesla webcam, using a USB holder for the tiny chip. A few months ago it started exhibiting freezing in the video recording. Then it completely failed. Plug it into a computer and it won't even show up as a device. Completely dead.These things are expensive, and simply don't last. Buying them is throwing money away...and throwing your data away. At this point I have to wonder if any flash memory technology is capable of actual "endurance", to last years as hard drives do. Companies that sell these things to the public obviously know they don't last long, and yet they don't hesitate to promote them as lasting a long time. This is misrepresentation.
