So, I bought this as an alternative to the Unicorn Beetle watch case/ band. I had several failures of the bands on the UB so, I started looking for an alternative. This came up, in my search and had decent ratings so, I thought I would give it a shot. That was a BIG mistake. I am fairly active and rely on the watch case to do its job and protect and RETAIN my watch. After a recent downhill mountain bike run at the local ski resort, I stopped for water, looked down and my watch and found that my watch popped through the TOP of the case and into oblivion. I spent 1.5 hours of my valuable family vacation time looking for my watch (That is another story. Long story short; Apple FindMy does NOT know where your watch is!) I was very frustrated with the case as this is a poor design for an ACTIVE watch band. Despite the band failures, I went back to the UB. Looking for better suggestions if anyone has one but, I would definitely avoid this one. A kind soul did find my watch on the trails a few days later but, this could have been a costly choice of case.
