Only reason I purchased was to be able to see hitch while backing up to a trailer. Ended up having to cut bracket down reposition camera then cut black plastic around camera to give it a lower viewing angle. Seems like it would be an easy fix for the manufacturer but it’s my fault for it listening to past reviews I had read about the product before purchasing. If you’re looking for a camera just for hitching up trailers, find another manufacturer.
