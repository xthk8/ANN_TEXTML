Too many things wrong with this camera. I've been using four of them for four months. I had to buy the Cloud Service for each device after the first night because the cameras triggered at everything. Every car, every person, every cat, every falling leaf. Drove me nuts.Cloud service mostly solves that but it still triggers for cats even when I've got Pets turned off.I've been buying the Cloud Service on a monthly basis. It doesn't remember my card. I have to put in all the card info for each camera each time. I should have an account that covers all cameras and that has a one-click renew.The Activity Zone feature never worked.The saved videos only fill the width of the phone in portrait view. They don't turn to fill landscape view.Now, suddenly, it won't let me renew my Cloud Service. I tried two debit cards and my PayPal account, all have funds, and keep getting a Payment Failed error. So I'm turning them all off and looking for new cameras.
