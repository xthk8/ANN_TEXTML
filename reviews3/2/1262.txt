Use these for work to leave my hands free for paperwork. Worked like a charm for the first few months but lately, the headset emits a few short beeps after being on my head for a few minutes. This is WITHOUT me having the handset off of the cradle! According to the manual, the beeps signify low battery; for goodness sakes; I've only had these since October 2021 (less than 6 months.)Very disappointed in this headset.
