And the weak link to these ear buds is the Air Wings. The pieces of very flexible, thin silicone slip over the hard body of the ear bud. When you put the ear bud into your ear, you then rotate them a little and the EarWings slip into the groove at the top of your ear. They work great!But...The ***constantly*** fall off and have the be re-attached and re-adjusted to fit your ear, only to fall off again unless you treat them super gently.Love the product otherwise, but this design sucks.
