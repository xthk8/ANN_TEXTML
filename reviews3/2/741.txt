I purchased this particular product because I assumed it would be made of nice and soft materials. Removed it after use for a few months and noticed it damaged the vent in my car by rubbing on it. While using it I also had constant problems with it dropping, falling, etc. so it doesn’t really hold the phone on the vent well. The $6 Walmart version I had before was more effective and never left damage on my vent. I’m pretty unhappy with my purchase. As far as holding the iPhone to the mount it was decent. The MagSafe magnets really aren’t strong enough to hold the obnoxiously heavy iPhone 13 pro very well. Don’t go over any large bumps, I did have my phone fall off the mount more than once.
