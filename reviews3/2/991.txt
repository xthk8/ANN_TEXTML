I used this in my dashcam (Which is only in use ~2 hours a day 3 days a week due to my commute) and it has stopped working completely and doesn't read. I've tried using the micro sd to usb adapter but also the micro sd->sd adapter in both my desktop and laptop to make sure it wasnt the adapters.I could understand if the device was being used a lot and failed, because they will fail eventually. However, with the light use mine had, failing after 5 months is a joke.
