That picture is literally how it arrived. I ran it through the paces and everything works but it’s amazing it didn’t get destroyed. I’m not sure if this was canon that did this or if I got an amazon return. The camera strap was already in place and there were fingerprints on the lens. I was angry until I found it wasn’t trashed. Picture quality is excellent. It’s simple to use and can be complete auto or complete manual and everything in between. This was a replacement for 10 year old Sony alpha. The alpha was a sturdier platform and quiter. The 2 stars is because of the packaging and the fact that I think it was a return that I paid full price for. I should have bought from Best Buy for the same price.
