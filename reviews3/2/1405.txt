Unfortunately, I only got 4 months use of this product. Didn't last a full year. Smh 🙄... now I gotta purchase another one. Just wasting money. The back piece cracked already.. so now it hangs on the ball swerving every time I turn left in my car. Ridiculous. 🤦🏾‍♀️ I need a built strong / durable cell phone holder.
