*UPDATE April '22*I never got around to using the Bondic to attempt a repair and glad I didn't waste my time. I continued to use it by spreading the clamp and putting the phone in since February. Finally, the rest of it broke and now it's completely useless. I'm going to check out other brands, keeping in mind that I'll probably get limited use out of it again, so I'll go cheaper in price. Raise the price and use metal parts! The rest of it is fine.I purchased this in November of 2019. Yesterday, 2/3/22 it broke. The right side plastic clip snapped while I was opening it. It saw regular duty 7 days a week as I used it next to my couch with my Samsung Note phone. It has otherwise held up well and worked as advertised. I would recommend this as something that will only work in the short term which is a shame as the arm is very well made. The clip appears to be removable, being held on by a nut and screw. I would gladly just purchase a new clip instead of a whole new item. I'm going to try and fix this with Bondic or glue.
