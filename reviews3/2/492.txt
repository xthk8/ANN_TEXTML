I purchased this brand of Laminating sheets because of the price. I purchased both these and the Scotch brand so that I could try them side by side. This brand is not even remotely close to the Scotch brand that I have used for years. You can feel the difference between the 2 brands and this one just does not come out smooth at all. The edges curled and there are bubbles everywhere. Not a happy customer trying the "off" brand.
