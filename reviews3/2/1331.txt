I’ve purchase this product 3 times. The first two times the cartridges worked perfectly in my printer. This last time however it wouldn’t work at all. The printer wouldn’t recognize that an ink cartridge was installed. I compared the “sensors” on the old and new cartridges and the sensors on the new one were way off. Since I’d ordered it to have on hand so that I’m never out of ink, the return window had already ended. I was stuck with no ink and no way to return the defective cartridge. I had to run out to purchase one from the store and it worked just fine.
