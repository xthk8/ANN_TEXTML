I am a teacher and needed laminating pouches for laminating things this upcoming year for my classroom. As I was using these laminating pouches, I was able to use about 40 then the rest were all very damaged as I got further into the pack. I have used this brand of pouches before many times with no issue, but Iâ€™m not sure if I will be buying again since many were not usable.
