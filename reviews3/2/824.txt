After a few months, the sides sheared off and lodged into the charging port of our iPad. Strangely, it would still charge if reconnected with this cord, but no other cord would fit because of the pieces wedged in there. Finally had to take it to the Apple Store to get them removed. (And get told repeatedly to only purchase MFi rated products, which this is, but I guess we drew the short straw.)
