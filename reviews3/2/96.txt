I didn’t expect something super fancy for the price, but I’ve run into several issues. First, it didn’t fit well into my vehicle using a standard size double DIN kit. Not sure if it is an issue with this radio having non standard screw holes or my vehicle just to being compatible with the kit.However, regardless of that, I took it on a short trip after installing it (installing it as best I could). I hooked it to the Apple CarPlay and called my wife. She could barely hear me. I was not using an external mic, just using the one built into the face of the radio. I could hear her just fine. The color on the screen was also washed out as some people had said. After getting to the store where I was going and cutting it off then back on, the screen froze with a message telling me to connect my phone (that was already connected). The message would not go away, the screen was frozen, and none of the physical buttons or buttons on the touch screen would unfreeze it. The only way to get it to unfreeze was turning the car off and back on. The message initially came up, but the screen was no longer frozen, and I could click off of it.Long story short, I would not really recommend this. I guess for the price, it’s not horrible. I also did not use an external microphone either to try to improve the sound quality. I never got to hooking up the backup camera as I’d already had the other issues.
