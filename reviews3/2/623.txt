They worked great, but I have to pair them with my tv everytime I turn them on. Pairing is usually very easy, but with this one it seems much more difficult than it should be. When I was able to use them they were great. I'm frustrated and hope that it's user error and I can get them working, but for now even my techy daughter who has wl headphones thinks something is wrong. It's not my Samsung tv, we tried with hers. I'm not giving up and I'll update if I figure out it's not headphones. Don't want to go e good product bad review.
