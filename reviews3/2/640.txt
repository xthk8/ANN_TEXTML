I used for Iphone 12 for landscape and portrait view. It would not balance without virtually flattening the bendable legs. Where the legs meet the they just flop around rather than having some hind of resistance which makes it tip even easier. Good design just needs the balance calculation redone and applied ti the design. Putting a different attach point for the legs so they donâ€™t flop around would entail redesigning that attachment.
