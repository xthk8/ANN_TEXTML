Where to start..? I needed a TV stand for my 46" LCD TV because I neglected to save the original stand the TV came with because I had it wall mounted. Well when it was time to upgrade I noticed I don't have a stand for my older TV so I jumped on Amazon checked out a few stands to meety needs and budget this is how I stumbled soon Wali TV stand. It claims to fit a wide range of TV sizes and it does. The assembly was very easy however during the assembly I noticed how cheaply made the hardware was (nuts and bolts, etc..) there are about 4 steps to assemble and I ended up putting it together wrong the first time. Deconstructing the first failed attempt I noticed the boots that hold the frame together we're already stripped, not because of my failed attempt but due to the lack of quality the hardware was made. Searching for extra parts in the kit there are none, so if your kit is missing any hardware one would have to go through the headache of calling Wali and explaining the missed hardware or damaged. I decided not to go that route but instead get my own quality hardware to finish the install. The Wali provided hardware didn't tighten properly and the screws stripped with basic install. I ended up getting 4 bolts and nuts that are quality made to finish the job. The stand works like it should however Wali should provide an extra bolt or 2 for the frame since it was so easy to strip the bolts that if I didn't replace the hardware myself I wouldn't have a TV stand. Note to buyers, search for a better brand or prepare to have your own hardware for a more secure and proper assembly.
