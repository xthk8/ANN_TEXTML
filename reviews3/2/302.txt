This looks old in my opinion. It has a yellow tint and reminds me of the yellow that nicotine leaves behind. I legit just put this on my kindle. The kindle is white and the case is clear. This isn't clear. I didn't realize how blugh looking it was until I put it on so I suppose I'm stuck with it. At least it's got the comfort of a standard pop socket.
