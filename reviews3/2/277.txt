For 5 months I liked this phone holder but now it is unusable due to the Clamp that holds the phone just snapped off during normal installation. The Clamp on the other end has held well and is of good quality. The phone holder Clamp needs redesigning. I noticed the last month of use it hasn't gripped the phone as firmly as it had in the past and now it is unrepairable.
