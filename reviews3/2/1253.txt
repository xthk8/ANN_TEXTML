We ordered 3 headsets for our office. The first one opened had a bad power cord, the light would not come on. We were able to hook up the other two just fine. Returned the bad headset and got a replacement today. The replacement also has a bad power cord. We confirmed the base works with one of the other power cords and tried the cord on multiple outlets, still doesn't work. These are too expensive to have this many issues. Our office needed these ASAP and had a plan to purchase more in the near future, but this has us concerned about the overall quality of the headsets.
