Seems to me that there was a problem with one of the cartridges. When I stuck it in my printer, it appeared to be full again, but started acting up, I think they sent me an old or dried up cartridge, or maybe it sat in the sun or a heated area? Of course by the time I got to use it and figured out that there was a problem with it (I thought there was a problem with the printer and was going to have to get a new one) the window to send it back or do anything about it was closed.When you pay as much for an ink cartridge, they should work and be good every time!
