My crappy $60 vlogging camera has a better mic. Which I didn't realise til I bought this mic.I have never bought a mic before.I make short sketch videos and short films.I do not use the camera/mic for vlogging. My need is for a mic that can pick up voice without all the background sounds, and don't want to use a lav mic yet.I usually shoot facing directly to the camera ( or close enough) in a variety of locations - outside with wind, breeze, inside an echoey place, a stairwell, bedroom etc.1st NOTES.THe sound picks up a lot of boom background.So much boom from the air.THe voice jostles with the hiss from the air.I hear the hiss and boom from the air each time I am not talking.The whole effect - LOUD.I am not interested in spending hours in post fiddling with audio. Why bother buying a mic?I'm using a Sony FDR-ax33.I did two tests. One with a crappy shotgun Bekester mic ( from a supercheap $60 vlogging camera),and one with this Movo mic.Totally expected Movo to be better.It wasn't.The background and picked-up sound is the let down. All I'm hearing is air. It doesn't sound professional. And I was shooting inside my room.It sounds bad enough with all that static, to make me not want to watch the video.Buy this is you have no idea about mics, or need the first step up from a built in mic.Do NOT buy this if you record voices in scenes, monologues, or anything that requires echo cancelling.
