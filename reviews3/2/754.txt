My iPhone 12 Pro Max in its MagSafe case weighs 274g, and the mount itself weighs 111g. The mount's magnet handles the total weight with aplomb, but its vent grip does not. Mine doesn't fully grip the vent louvers with enough force to safely support a total weight of 385g for any length of time over anything but a perfectly smooth road. This is the case for my two vehicles with different vent designs. It may work better with a smaller phone, and if the vent louvers of your vehicle are spaced closer together to provide extra friction, but for the 12 Pro Max, I'd look elsewhere (and if you find one, please let me know). I'm disappointed, because I like Belkin products.
