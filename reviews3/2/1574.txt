This cable worked for a couple of months of daily use, but then the connection started becoming unreliable. I would move it around slightly and get a good connection, but then a couple of minutes later I'd lose the connection. It finally got to the point that I couldn't get any connection no matter how I jiggled it, so I had to buy another one.This is the second Amazon basics cable I've bought that has failed after just a small amount of use. From now own I will buy better quality cables.
