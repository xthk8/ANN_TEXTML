This is the strongest adhesive available from Brother and I got it to identify electrical wire (after searching the Brother site). It does not work. Not even for 24 hours sitting inside at room temperature. It is better than the standard tape that peeled loose after 12 hours, but that's not good enough for duty outside or in adverse conditions.I made labels and stuck them lengthwise wrapped around the wires. Looks good at first; peeled off in hours.
