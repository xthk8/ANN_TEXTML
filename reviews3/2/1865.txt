The cable seems like good quality and sound comes in while my headsets is plugged in, but I can't give a good or great overall rating. I use this with my gaming headset and for some reason my buddy's can't hear me and yet I can hear them fine. I've gone through the settings and looked up trouble shoots, but no dice. If anyone can help, I would like to give it a better review but can't if the cable doesn't perform at its best.
