Have you ever spontaneously wanted to hear a song, or an artist, or just some music right now? Well, then Sonos is NOT for you.When Sonos works, it sounds incredible. Unfortunately, Sonos doesn't work very often. Rebooting everything, including your router, sometimes does the trick but only about 15% of the time. Hard resetting the speaker and starting over fixes it 80% of the time, but takes 15 minutes and often works for just for a single-use.Sonos support will help as long as you don't want to listen to music on the weekend. They will make lots of excuses, but the truth is they have great hardware paired up with terrible software. They have told me it is my modem, that one of the speakers got wrong firmware, that I have interference from another wireless device, that the speakers must have been powered off during a firmware update and on and on. But I am using six separate Sonos setups in three different countries, with five different modems and every one of them is a problem.I installed over $10,000 worth of Sonos in my homes and businesses before I realized how buggy it was. I hope you don't fall into the same trap. I have NEVER returned to a location after being gone for a month to find the Sonos speakers working. Not once did they function even if they were working when I left.But, if you don't heed my warning, be sure you buy your Sonos speakers on Amazon, so you can put it right back in the box and send it where it came from.
