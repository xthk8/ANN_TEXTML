I received this and the lifter would only fully lift maybe 5% of the time. There were instructions included for the lifter, but no instructions/manual for the headset. I found a YouTube video to set up and I could hear people but they could not hear me (yes, I checked the mute button and pressing that and undressing did nothing to improve it). The mute button is also not ideally placed; you have to reach under the bottom of headset to mute. I also found that the headset resting in its cradle would get tangled with all the wires for the headset and lifter.
