Like other reviewers, this may or may not "click" into place to secure the connection. It worked fine on my daughter's computer, but when I tried to plug it into the back of my (2020) computer, it would not "click" to secure. It also would not "click" into the back of our Router. In both scenarios, we ended up using electrical tape to make sure the cord doesn't fall out. Will try a box cutter to see if peeling back the black rubber casing will work.
