I really wanted to like this product. I really wanted to give it 5 stars, especially because of how good the mic is for the really low price. However, the mount/arm it came with is completely useless. No matter how tight I get it, moving it once or twice causes it falls off the desk. There is literally no way to get this thing to stay on my desk and I have a very normal nothing special desk that has worked no problem with my other various mounts of the same type. The clamp is literally just a very tiny metal circle that doesn't hold onto anything. You'd have to superglue this thing to get it to stay on a desk. Don't bother with this product.
