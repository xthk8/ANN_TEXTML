Most of my experiences with Anker have been extremely positive, so I was shocked at all the issues that these headphones had. They feel very cheaply made and this was disappointing for a pair of $150.00 headphones. The audio quality out of the box is extremely bad, everything sounds washed out to the point where I questioned whether my headphones were defective. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but you cannot download any programs to fix this for your computer. I also had a lot of connection issues with these. Overall, I'd recommend trying something else to avoid all of these caveats.
