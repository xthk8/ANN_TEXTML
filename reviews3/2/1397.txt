Everything about this mount is great, except the ratcheting clamp.I bought this in June 2021, using it an average of 1-2 times a week with my phone for GPS.Today, I was driving a new route, my phone suddenly fell off and onto the car floor, no major bumps, just fell. I had to wait to find a safe area to pull over and recover my phone. I attempted to remount the phone, the ratchet clamp would not stick firmly, it kept slipping to a wider gap. The mount can no longer hold my phone securely.If they could make the ratchet mechanism out of something more durable, not what I assume to be plastic, this very likely would not be an issue. So, less than a year, 1-2 uses a week, the ratchet mechanism has worn out. Can't recommend at this time.
