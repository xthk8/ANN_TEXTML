It arrived used and missing the shield, but I was able to attach it to my bins and see how it would work. If you don't have a long lens camera and you want to take a few pics of slow moving objects from your house or car window - this will be fun to play with.For birder's - no You have to walk around in the field with your phone hooked onto your binoculars. The phone keeps turning off or getting moved and so you have to turn on the phone and re adjust it. Meanwhile the bird is gone. While you are out there you can only see the bird with one lens because you have this gadget on the other lens. Also, I am afraid it might tork the bins and get them out of focus if knocked or when laying it down.I took one pic with this and one with my camera (fujifilm finepix) at the same magnification - It was actually close. But two things stood out - lack of pixels, and the picture is round. The detail was just not there - though the picture looked clear. I took a picture holding the phone up to the bins, and it was a lot easier than hooking in the adapter and turned out the same.
