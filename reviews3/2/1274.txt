Unfortunately, I missed the return window on this item but I was hoping to eventually get it to fully work. I can hear perfectly when I answer the phone (and it is ridiculous to have a wireless headset but I still have to physically answer the phone first). However, no one is able to hear me. I have tried muting and unmuting and still the person on the other end cannot hear me. So looks like I am out the $60 for this.
