Just as the title states, I ordered one it did not function on arrival. After troubleshooting with the chat help we were not able to get it functioning properly. It worked for a little bit and then would stop. They sent me another one and it was the same situation. The microphone did not work on a regular basis. The kit itself was very cool, I am disappointed that I did not get to use the whole set up because it was a nice kit.
