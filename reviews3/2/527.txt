These laminating sheets are much cheaper than many others, but they are also cheap in quality. Many of the things I laminate end up having creases in them when using these sheets, and that's never been an issue with other laminating sheets. I guess it's fine to laminate unimportant things, but I would not use them for important or expensive items and you never know if the sheet is going to laminate correctly or ruin your paper.
