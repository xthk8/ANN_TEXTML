I was using this item for a few weeks, mostly for charging phones and game systems which it worked great for. It was nice to have two different plug options and a large amount of outlet options. I also liked that I could hang it horizontally above our desk with the two provided holes.Unfortunately, after those few weeks - it just stopped working. I'm not sure what went wrong, as I do not believe we ever over-loaded it or anything like that. It was a real bummer since it was working so well for us. I really liked not having to bother with the cubes for charging my cell phone. I'll have to find another one to replace it now.
