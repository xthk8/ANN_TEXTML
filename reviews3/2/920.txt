I have been using these for over a month now. The battery life of the left ear piece is about 4.5 hours and the right ear piece is about 10 minutes longer (advertised as 6 hour use between charges). Case does include a battery that holds more than one charge. BUT mine does not hold 4 full charges. At full charge the case seems to have about 2.5-3 charges (advertised as having a case with 4 full charges of battery built into case at full charge). Sound quality is nice but less than standard iPhone wired headphones. They are very light weight though as advertised.
