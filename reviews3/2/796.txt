Everything looked good until i opened up the inner case and took a look at the actual headphones... here was this weird substance on it that only got worse as i tried to clean it ... no idea what the hell it is ( it seemed like powdery at first so i assumed dirt but it's not coming off)Sound quality was a weird one ... They don't actually sound too bad in Noise Cancelling adn Transparency Modes... but in Normal Mode they sound pretty bad ... very muddy, no separation ... I'm assuming this is mostly a tuning thing with the preset and I've not tried the app yet... but that was first impression right out of the boxI got these for gym headphones but might have to return them since they are already dirty before i've even had a chance to try themMy daily driver headphones are Beyer Dynamic DT880 Pros so those are my point of reference ( i also have some Tozo T6 that have temp replaced my Jabra Elite 65T when those died a few weeks ago) .
