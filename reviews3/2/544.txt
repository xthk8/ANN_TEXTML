Bought this to cut the cord, but unless your incoming signal is perfect, it continues to cut in and out and the sound is out of sync at points. I use the Roku app. I tried to adjust the antenna, I tried amp/filters, and checked and double checked connections. I get perfect signal with my tv going direct, but, as soon as I run it it thru the Homerun it doesn't give you a steady picture. It may be The Router, but, all the other streaming apps work perfect on my network. Great concept and It set up easy and it was nothing to edit the stations, but I can't get it to work for me. I have read many great reviews and thought I would get that kind of response, but, not so much. I'm out of ideas, so maybe I will return it.
