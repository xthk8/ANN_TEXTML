Too big for my normal ears. We bought these for my daughter because they were advertised for small ears but they’re huge! The part that sticks in is moderately sized but the part that is supposed to nest in the outer ear is huge. They barely stay in my ears and there’s no way they’d stay in my daughter’s ears.
