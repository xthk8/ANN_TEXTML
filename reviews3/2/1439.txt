I bought this on 20 March 2021, so return window is closed. It was a backup toner for my business. I installed it today on 27 June 2021 and it makes a loud knocking noise when printing. I should have installed it right away to check it out. I figured Bother brand products would have good quality control but apparently not. I am stuck with a defective toner. Always check the right away. Big company does not always equal good quality checks.
