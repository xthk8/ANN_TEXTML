Bought this to try and add a second external monitor to my teenager's Chromebook - the first/only HDMI port is already in use. Failed gloriously.Wanna use this with Windows? Plug it in - it will detect as a storage device when you connect it first. That external device contains an install file to make this device work - you'll have to browse to it and run the .exe file. As I read it, you'll get a working monitor with an image of marginal quality.Wanna use it with Chromebook? Sorry, nope. If your Chromebook is a little older, and does not have USB-C ports to use (like mine), you're up a creek.I rated it low because competitors on Amazon actually state that theirs is not Chromebook compatible...but I guess this one stating that it features support for Windows XP should have been my first red flag.
