I'd review the product quality but I couldn't use it. The reason I'm reviewing it all is because of its lack of hardware. All the mounts I've bought provided all the possible types of screws that may be used. This unit only has 3 screw sizes. It's advertised to follow VESA standards and lists the sizes of tvs that should work. I shouldn't have had a problem with a small tv at all, especially since it's not the smallest. Before purchasing this unit make sure you verify the size of the screws you'll be given and the size your tv takes.EDIT I gave one star back for customer service. I contacted the seller and they promptly sent me new m4x12mm screws that fit the tv...but not the bracket. The screw heads slipped through the bottom holes and barely held in the small top holes. Washers would fix the problem but I'm still back at square one. I hate that I'm reviewing the product less than the customer support and listing, but it is very flawed. If you had a larger tv than 32" you MAY not have any issue. If the product actually did work with my 32" TCL Roku TV I would give 3 stars for the quality of the mount. It will work under the right circumstance but it seems relatively flimsy. The design is simple enough to be sturdy to a degree. It should be sturdier given the depth from the wall and design. The depth isn't that much but I would trust the flush wire mounts just as much if not more than this one. It's kind of a lose lose. I wouldn't trust a large investment on it. I would trust my lightweight 32" or smaller on it if it were more accommodating
