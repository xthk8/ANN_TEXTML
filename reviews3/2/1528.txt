Having purchased an all black case, I was looking for an all black Popsocket. This one looked cute in the photos, but I was mislead. It is NOT all black (see my photos). Also, based on the photos, I thought the background was like a matte black and the print was a glossy black (I have cups with this design). It was not. It's a black background and gray print. I tried to look past these flaws but I didn't like the look of it on my all black case. The description also says that Popsockets are easily repositionable, which is also a lie. I bent my credit card trying to get it off my phone case and the adhesive is now deformed, so if you were to reuse it, it would not adhere as well. Needless to say, I returned this item.
