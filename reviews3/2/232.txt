Main photo isn’t accurate. Has word RESIST on the bottom. Not sure what we’re resisting but whatever. Also says SPORT on the little metal tag on the left side. I love how Chinese manufacturers just pick super random words that don’t pertain to the product and stamp them all over the product. Pretty comfortable and appears to be more or less durable, but doesn’t really look like the pics on here. The bolt heads are clearly just rubber simulated and don’t stand out against the rest of the band. Meh.
