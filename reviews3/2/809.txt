Not as loud or as bass heavy or as clear or as comfortable as previous generations.. but the noise canceling works.. smh....Seriously. If your ears are 110% and you don't ever need to turn your headphones all the way up these may be for you. But anyone that needs to dissociate for real or block out some heavy unique (sporadic/nondroning) noise? Keep shopping or get former generations. The 35s and 30s are better and cheaper.I unpacked and repacked them in the span of 3 days. Not a good look for quality audio. If you focus on mids they may work for you.
