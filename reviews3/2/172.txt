Make no mistake...this lens mod is amazing...but what you need to search before you purchase this lens mod is "GoPro Max Lens Mod Won't Fit" or lock. After a painfully long chat with GoPro support...taking and uploading photos and serial numbers they took care of me. The issue is not the lens, it's the way the camera body flanges are machined most likely. The issue is when trying to turn the lens mod the 1/4 turn needed to lock it in place it does not want to go. I will tell you chatting with support I said F it...If I break it I break it. I put so much torque on that lens it was going to break or the camera was...it moved that small increment and finally locked. You'll find all kinds of weird fixes on youtube...like turn it back n forth for an hour until it finally locks in place. GoPro support asked me to send back the camera (GoPro Hero9 Black) for a replacement..I'm assuming the replacement camera will have a slight taper on the flanges so the lens mod glides smoothly into place. If you do find yourself needing support, take photos of your camera and lens serial numbers and also have your sales receipt or purchase email ready for GoPro support to help you. If you have everything in order, they'll send you a replacement camera. Once I get it, I'll check the flanges and do another report or youtube video to help others that might encounter same issue.UPDATE: Getting my HERO9 ready to return to GoPro for replacement and discovered this... putting the original removable lens cap back on you can see a very tiny gap. I would not recommend trying to force the GoPro Max Lens Mod on...contact GoPro and let support help you out. I tested the lens last night...It's amazing, but it's not worth screwing your HERO9 up if it's out of warranty.
