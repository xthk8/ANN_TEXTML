I used this in an Amcrest security camera in my livingroom (light use) and it stopped recording after 3 months. When I tried to format the card on my macbook pro using FAT32, I got an error. I bought this card because I needed something that would have more endurance than a standard MicroSD card. Warranty was just for 1 month. I lose.
