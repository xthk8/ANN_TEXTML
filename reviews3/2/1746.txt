My receiver power switch was flaky from the start; should have immediately returned them. Now it won't power off the receiver and needs to be shipped back with an estimated 4 week turn time on the warranty. No, they won't ship a replacement. The units were great when working.Recommendation: use the mics/receivers right away and return them if ANY sign of flaky behavior.
