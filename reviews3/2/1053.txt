When I inserted this particular cartridge in my printer, I followed the steps I usually do - print the page alignment page (which looked different than it has in times past), place it on the printer to insure proper alignment, and then print that page as well. Both pages had a triangle with an exclamation point in the center, and the instructions which are usually toward the bottom of the page, was not distinguishable at all. I attempted several different troubleshooting adjustments to my printer (an HP Envy 4500), and the results were the same; the print is so light it is indistinguishable. I reinserted the old cartridge, and there was enough ink in it to determine that it was printing black with the remnants of ink that remained in it. I can only assume that this cartridge is defective.
