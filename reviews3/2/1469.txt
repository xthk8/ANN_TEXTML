I donâ€™t know what happened here... the cartridge was empty in a few days. Half gone after only 10 copies! I got around 100 or less copies even after setting it for lower quality print. It took longer than usual to get, I think it traveled from the east coast? Anyway, already had to get a replacement. This thing just dried up and went kaput!
