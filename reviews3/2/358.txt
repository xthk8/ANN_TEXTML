For the past few weeks, this mic has been really good, its audio quality is impressive for the price point and it comes with 2 different pop filters and a desk grip. When the mic is working properly, I have no complaints and would fully recommend this product.HOWEVER, when I first received the mic, the set up process was an absolute nightmare, for over 2 hours, the mic's volume was incredibly low for no reason. I checked multiple sound setting options, the device's drivers, and unplugged and replugged the mic several times to no avail. In the end, I'm honestly not sure what solved my issue but that low volume nightmare even when the mic was on 100 for sound was really unfortunate. If my problems ended there I would have left this mic with a 4 star review, but throughout the past few weeks my mic has occasionally gone haywire on things like discord or zoom. Before you make any assumptions, both applications were fully updated and I believe were not the source of the problem as it occurred even in mic playback in windows audio settings. When my mic does this, other users hear an extremely loud static/buzzing sound that actually hurts. My mic's drivers are completely fine so I believe this is a hardware issue. To solve this, I have unplug and replug the USB connections multiple times over several minutes as sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.This mic is a quality product when it performs as it should, but the reliability of it doing so has brought my rating down from what would be 4 stars to 2 stars. I can't even in good conscious give this 3 stars with its current problems because entering a call to give people ruptured ear drums is just such a huge concern I have everytime I communicate with people now
