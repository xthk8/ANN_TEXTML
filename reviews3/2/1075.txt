I purchased two of these in March of this year, 2018. The first one worked beautifully no problems. The second I placed in printer today and got an error message to replace the cartridge due to be defective. I tried several times to clean the copper points, as suggested by HP, but no success. I even unplugged the printer as suggested. I place the old cartridge back in and viola it worked but low ink. Placed the new one back in still not working. Not a good deal if you have one out of two not performing as expected. Unfortunately no customer support on this item. Very disappointing.
