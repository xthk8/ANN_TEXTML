These look much nicer than the silicone ones I tried at first, and I had high hopes that they would be more durable, but that was unfortunately not the case. The snap is not very secure so it comes undone often. My son has already lost an AirTag due to it falling off of his keychain and my husband has almost lost one on his keyring. So far the dog's has stayed intact, so I'll give it two stars.
