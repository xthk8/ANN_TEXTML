Wish there had been more reviews from folks with longer hair. The design is only decent for people with very short hair that would not get tangled in the side piece opposed the headphone EVERY time it's worn/removed from the head. It should be a single unit without a gap. Pulling hair back in a clip/rubber band does not solve the issue of this side piece nesting into the hairline.
