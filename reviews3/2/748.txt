The magnet is strong. The material and build quality are nice. The swivel action maintains its position.Unfortunately, this mount does not lock itself to the car vent. It merely slides onto the vent louvers.When I pull my IPhone 13 Pro directly away from the mount, the mount slides off the vent and remains stuck to my phone. I have to pull my phone off the mount at an angle so the mount stays put. Also, my phone and the mount will randomly fall off the car vent due to the mount working itself off on its own. To combat this, I have to make sure the mount is 100% on the vent louver every single time I place my phone on the mount.For its intended purpose, I have to say I'm quite unsatisfied with this mounts main and most important function. The stability of a phone's car mount should not be a concern when a person is operating a vehicle.
