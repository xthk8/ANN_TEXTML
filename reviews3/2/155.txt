My son and i bought this camera so we could record in our plane. We used it for a entire week and some video we shot was 360 videos to the tune of 58 8 min videos. The rest totaling about 60 videos we shot on hero mode. The hero mode videos came out great and we were able to down load them onto our computer and watch them. The problem was when we tried to download and watch the 360 video. We tried for several days and never could get them to play. After about 6 hours of digging online and reading a crap load of forums we finally figured it out. So we downloaded all programs and set to download all our 360 videos. We started the download on saturday August 7 about 6pm. It finally finished 7 days later. Now before anyone says my computer is slow i own a very pricy and very fast laptop. As i have to use for my work. Also we stopped the download about 6hours in and tried on my sons gaming computer. Same outcome. So back to the laptop we went. So when the downloads completed we proceeded to watch the footage. The footage was great on the files that actually downloaded. Out of the 58 we downloaded on 37 actually downloaded. And the rest were nothing except sound. We bought this to video my sons first trip to Airventures and there were plenty of him talking about how excited he was to go also we have video from the outside of the plane that is now gone. So i gave this camera 3 stars because the Hero foortage is excellent and the 360 footage what we could see was good except it is jerky. So buyers beware. If you plan on doing 360 videos with this camera you can only use the gopro app to see the footage or use their worthless computer program to download. Or if i read right buy some big expensive program from a third party. I am returning this camera and getting the Hero 9 since we can download directly onto the computer.
