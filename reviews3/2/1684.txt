Returned them due to the fact that they would not stay fit in my ears no matter what. Could not work out in them at all and was very anxious wearing them even when just walking down the street because they felt very loose. I tried to use different sized tips but did not change the results. When they wouldn't fall off my ear (I would be sitting or laying down very still) the noise cancellation was really good. These are fine just be aware that they might not fit your ears
