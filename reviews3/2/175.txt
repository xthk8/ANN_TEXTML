For $20 can't complain much cuz you get what you pay for. Sound quality is decent and connection to my iphone was painless. 1 ear bud dies quicker than the other even tho I use them both at the same time.More importantly, they do not work for facetime calls. Facetime audio always switches back to phone speakers and if I leave these ear buds connected then they cause all sorts of problems with my facetime call, even going so far as to cause my phone to hang up. So I always have to disconnect the ear buds from my phone before the call in order for the call to work properly.I do not recommend unless you need a quick and cheap short term remedy for music listening.For reference I have iphone 11 pro max with latest updates. Maybe they will work better on android, Idk.
