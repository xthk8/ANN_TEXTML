I’ve had these for less than a year and they’ve kinda broke. The left earbud hums loudly, so I’m pretty much just using the right earbud. It’s annoying cause I’ve taken good care of them and they’ve still broke. They were amazing at first until I began having all these problems. I know it’s not just me because my brother used them for a while and he dealt with the same problems. Truly not worth the money spent.
