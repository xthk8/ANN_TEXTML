I tried to load pictures but was unsuccessful. Brother cartridges have an orange plastic piece which covers the opening and have to be removed when you plan to load them. Neither of these had those covers. When I placed the cartridge in the printer, the screen which shows the amount of ink left is not full to the top.Someone opened the package, uncovered the ink opening and repackaged the cartridges. It is too late to return them--I usually buy a set to have on hand--but quality control needs to look into this. I will not buy these from Amazon again.
