The sound is pretty decent, but they constantly fall out of my ears no matter which accessory I use. They'd be fine if you don't move around more than walking, but while I'm working, I'm constantly messing with them which is a real drag. I've tried all the different parts they come with and twist and turn to no avail..they keep falling out. Spent a good half hour looking in the dirt for them more than once..I'm about to buy a different brand , b/c they're too frustrating to use...bummed!
