I have put together enough foreign-made products to know that there are always challlenges between bad directions or part problems. This was no exception. I was sent 2 of the same-side arms to screw to the back of the TV (instead of a L and a R, I got two L's). I made it work, you can't see anything I did from the front of the TV, and the legs look right at the bottom, but this was sealed in plastic in the factory like this. Quality Control is seriously lacking. I don't think it will affect the sturdiness or the integrity of the product, but many people might need to return this or wouldn't be able to work through it.
