Nice looking product and quickly received. However, could not get it to work in Windows 7 environment. Also, even though I could not get it to work properly, I began to get the impression that it is designed to only allow display of your PC onto another monitor, not vice versa. In other words, this probably will not work if your goal is to display a hdmi video from eg a Sony Cybershot onto your Sony Vaio laptop in real time, attempting to use your laptop display as a monitor to your active external camera device (true mirroring). AMZ quickly allowed for return but beware "unpackaged UPS return". I thought I would have easy return to local UPS drop off counter, but UPS drop off was completely uneducated as to what an "unpackaged" return was. They wanted to see a package with a preprinted return slip which is not provided by AMZ in these instances. I had to drive 15 miles out to a real UPS store who was well aware about "unpackaged returns" and simply grabbed my unboxed item and threw it in an AMZ return bin. The receipt i got for this transaction was poor, as it only stated that I showed up at the UPS store and gave them "an item" without any reference to what it was, original order #, etc. That said, I did get a quick refund from AMZ, but in the form of a gift card balance.
