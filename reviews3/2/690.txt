Lamical says this stand can be used for cell phones, e-readers, tablets-- you name it, this gadget can hold it! Well, not so much. I will concede that it looks really cool holding my tablet aloft above my bluetooth keyboard like I live in some futuristic utopia, but if I try to touch my tablet, the whole thing falls over. No touchie. Since you kinda have to touch tablets, nope. Doesn't work. Phones stay propped up but it is ridiculous to try to text with your phone on a stand on a table next to you. Also, you can't talk on the phone unless you want to be on speaker. The thing you end up using it for is charging-- that neat little hole in the back was some good design planning, right? Well, the minute you disconnect your device, the cord slithers off to wherever unreachable cords go, so not exactly. It works okay with e-readers. My Kindle Paperwhite sits in it just fine and it works great until I have to swipe for a page turn. It falls over every third swipe or so. As for Lamical's claims that the stand is adjustable, they mean "metal can be bent to a different angle." To me, permanent disfigurement is not the same as adjustability. Two stars for looking cool-- I really wanted to use this.EDIT: Lamical's customer service is on point. Within 24 hours of posting this review, they contacted me and said my product sounded defective. They offered me a replacement or a full refund. I stand by my review in the understanding that not everyone will have the same experience; kudos to Lamical for their great job of swooping in like Batman to satisfy the customer.
