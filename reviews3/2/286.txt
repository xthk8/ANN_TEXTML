Product has a great phone clamping mechanism. However the clap that holds the device to a table ( or whatever you are mounting it to) isn’t strong enough to hold the device to table as the movement of the “ tube” is way way …did I say way way way to stiff.I have moved the clamping device off my table several times while adjusting the “ tube”.It basically takes two hands to move the tube… and this assumes you don’t break the table ( main clamp)…. The clamp either needs “ teeth or groove edges so clamp can hold or the tube needs to be made more flexible…
