So this is what I was worried about. You have an extendable arm MEANT to move and adjust to different position. So WHY is it now broken, because I have been using it in different positions. This is EXACTLY why I do NOT recommend this. IF you move it too much, like they say you can, IT WILL BREAK. so annoying.
