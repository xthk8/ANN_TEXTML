I just got a camera and was looking for film everywhere but decided to get it through amazon since it was the most convenient option for me. I was really disappointed since it arrived later than expected and came a bit banged up. If I payed for free shipping I wouldnâ€™t be so upset for the delay but since the cheapest shipping option was even a bit pricey and it arrived late it annoyed it. I just am hoping that the film is undamaged now.
