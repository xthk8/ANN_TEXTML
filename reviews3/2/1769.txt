i have a mono laser printer for most of my black printing that does the heavy lifting. i purchased this for air printing and color. the hi yield two pack black 400pg ran out in 7mo this ran out in 7mo i barely print color. Beware of yellow, it runs out quickest. going to try generic or low yield. i’m suspecting low fill or drying. the quality isn’t amazing rather dull too.
