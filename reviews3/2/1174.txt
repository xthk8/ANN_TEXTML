We got some to use here at the office. There are better devices out there to get instead of those. It loses video for a couple of seconds about twice a day, and the quality is not good at all (looks like it has less colors than the image is supposed to have. We can see the colors changing instead of a perfect degradee). We'll not order it again in the future
