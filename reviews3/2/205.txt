The cord seems durable enough, but the charge it produces it not equivalent to other similar chargers. Takes my phone about 2x longer to charge compared to my old USB-C to Lightning cable. This cord also does not work for my iPad at all, I tried all 3 and no luck. I’m not sure why it wouldn’t as any other charger cable works just fine. I ended up purchasing a new brand and am much happier with it. I wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone unless you’re in a pinch for a charger that only works half as well as it should for cheap. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more and get a better product.
