I was very excited to try these tips out, however, after using them for a couple of weeks I noticed that my apple pencil would randomly stop writing. At first it was only a couple of times but now it randomly stops writing more often and it's very frustrating. I switched the tip out with the second one it came with but the same thing kept happening. I thought it was my pencil so I put the original apple pencil tip back on and it worked perfectly. I don't know if anyone else experienced this or maybe I just received faulty tips.
