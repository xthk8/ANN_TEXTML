(initial review): This was received today and was stupid simple to set up with the app. The sound is flawless and fills a large room. I have been listening to this for about 7 hours straight with Christmas, rock, classical, instrumental, and oldies... Trueplay is very good at adjusting the acoustics to the room where the Move has been placed. I have been using a JBL Charge 3 for the past two years and was completely satisfied with it but this takes listening to music to a whole other level. Very strongly recommended even at the 299 price point.(Updated review): 12/1/2022 - It's all about the app which is an epic failure. I just wanted a very good BT speaker but the Sonos Move fails in that regard. After two years, I just got sick of having to open the app and navigate through to be able to play music from sirius XM. The standard BT sound is absolutely horrible so you must go through the Sonos App to be able to listen to what you want to hear. I sold this and purchased an HK Studio speaker to replace it. The HK is equal to the Sonos in sound quality without the proprietary hoops to jump through and was significantly cheaper (and I mean A LOT cheaper). Yes, this speaker sounds great but at a steep price and with proprietary requirements that limit its versatility.
