I bought this about 4 to 5 months ago and now it has stopped charging. I would’ve spent $10 more or however much more the Apple cords are and bought an Apple cord. Now I have to spend another $25 so dollars and buy an Apple cord. This really upsets me. The reviews are so good on this charger but, they’re probably fooled like I was when you get to the 4 th month..so annoying.
