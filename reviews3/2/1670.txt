You'll find my old review below. I bought these 6 months ago. I no long use them unless my other branded buds are dead. I leave them in my gym bag Incase I forget to charge my other ones or leave them at home. That's about it, they make a good emergency pair. They fall out of my ears when working out all the time. But the biggest problem is the disconnect all the time. My other buds are dead so 8ve been using them for the past hour hand have had to reconnect twice. They just stop being connected and I have to turn off Bluetooth and turn it back on. It happens so often themat they are just unuassable. Honestly wish I could have my money back.ðŸ¤·These buds are awesome. I bought foam ear tips to replace the rubber ones that came with the buds. Once I had these on the buds became dangerous. You can't hear anything except what your listening to. I put on noise cancelation and mowed my lawn with the volume half way up and could hear the podcast perfectly. There is a function to let in ambient noise if your out in public which is awesome and works great. Battery life is great. Size is great. Fits in my ear and looks really good. The only issue is if you want to use Google or amazon assistant (maybe Siri, don't know, I use android) you then can not use the left earbud on it's own. But in the setting, turn the functionally to handset only and then you can use either bud independently. I had to contact Sony to figure this out. I don't use Google/Amazon assistant so it doesn't bother me. I've used airpods for years and hate the stem and the fact that they are white. These look so good, you can sleep with them in. They are also very light at 5 grms each. It's only been a week but I'm sold. If something comes up I'll update for sure.
