The charger comes with a cable that USB-C doesn't work with your traditional USB car outlet or any regular USB cables. You have to buy a 20W USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 car power supply which adds another 30-20 dollars to the price. For this already expensive charger, this is a very poor decision to sell you only half and you have to deal with the frustration to expend more money and wait more time in order to use it.
