Got his lens and unlike the 3 other Sigma lenses I bought this year, this lens it too fat at the area where it mounts with not enough clearance for fingers. Unlike all my other lenses for Sony they do not have a serrated V cut ring with sharp edges right where the lens goes wide. This raw edge of sharp aluminum digs into you finger. Put it on my camera and and in just walking around inside the house I had a bleeding 1st knuckle joint on my middle finger.
