It worked fine for the first 3-4 months. The unit obviously still gets power, as the on/off/reset indicator still lights up when you turn it on. However, zero of the plugs are now powered. There have been no surge events I am aware of, nor did any other of our MANY power strips go out. I'm left to assume there is a quality issue here. There appears to be a warranty, so I will be pursuing that with Amazon. Hopefully I am quite simply an outlier and just "lucky".
