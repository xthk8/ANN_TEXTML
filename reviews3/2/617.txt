I needed these to cancel noise from outside of my apartment. I have neighbors who listen to music where the bass shakes my walls, etc and it's really wreaks havoc on my anxiety when I'm trying to relax inside my home. A lot of times, I can't watch tv, read a book or anything else as it's just too loud outside and earplugs or ear buds really hurt for me to wear.My last inexpensive noise cancelling headphones worked better but I've had them for about two years now and the charging port collapsed inside it so I could no longer charge them. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the same ones so I researched reviews before deciding on these. I ended up choosing them as I needed lower cost and had to get something quickly as the noise invading my personal space literally makes me ill.So, as far as sound, they are decent. But, for the purpose of cancelling outside noise, they are not comparable to my other pair. There is a button u push to turn on the noise cancellation, however, I really don't see much difference.I have to take them off to hear my son speaking to me, but can still hear the booming bass outside through the headset. How does that even happen?If I turn up the volume on what I'm watching, it helps, but I shouldn't have to blast out my eardrums in order to enjoy them when that is the opposite of what I need them for.Battery life: I don't use them for long enough to be able to give an opinion as I only need them when it's loud outside, but they have survived, off charger, for at least 4-5 hours of use before I remove them and put them back on the charger.If you need something easy and inexpensive, they are "ok".Not as good as others around the same price so, my honest opinion is to research reviews before you purchase to get the most bang for your buck before settling.When I am able, I will find a better pair to serve my needs at a comparable price, but for now, these will suffice.
