Ordered this charger on July 21,2020 along with a braided black one of the same brand. This is did not last that long. I got about 2 months use out of it and then threw it away. It is not rust proof or durable. It started tearing right below the connector, cables were visible. This charger was used while the phone wasn't in use. I didn't feel like it was worth it to pay shipping to get a new one. It did charge super fast and length was good, just didn't last long.
