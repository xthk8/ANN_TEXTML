I have used Platronics headsets for over 15 years. They last a long time and they are usually reliable. But I decided to upgrade recently to the CS540 and not only did the first unit not work but the replacement (second unit) broke on the day I received it. It's a shame that the quality has deteriorated so badly. Off to find a new brand.....
