Even though this product claims to be 3ml, it is definitely flimsier than what I normally get. The pieces that I put into the film slide around and I have found it very difficult to load into the laminator without things shifting. I would return this, but by the time I got a chance to use it, I was past the return date. Iâ€™m not sure if I can suffer through 200 sheets of it.
