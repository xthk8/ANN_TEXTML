BE AWARE! I bought these headphones in November and now, only 3 months later, they are not charging!!!! Super frustrating!If you are ok with them not working after a few months, just know the headphones were only good at playing music, hence the 2 stars. Other than that, they don't do well if you are answering phone calls!
