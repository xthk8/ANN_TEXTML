When moving windows around or scrolling down excel files (nothing that demands high graphics processing) it lags. I don't know how to put it other than it's like the frame rate is at 5fps. I installed this for my girlfriends 3rd work monitor. It might just be my computer compatibility with this dongle, but it is unusable if you aren't watching a static screen - might be good for monitoring stocks, crypto graphs as long as you don't have to scroll.I will say the set up was easy - if you know a little bit about computers. The driver install file names don't match the instructions, but there are only 3 options - android, naxos, and the third one doesn't say windows it will have abbreviations. It was easy for me to figure out, but only because I've done this before. If you are a first time user, you may want some help installing the drivers.
