Bought this super high-yield toner cartridge thinking it was a better bang for the buck. Without printing enough pages that would even require a standard toner cartridge (TN820), the cartridge blew toner all over the inside of the printer. I had to clean the inside of the printer, the drum, etc. I tried it again. The same thing happened. Cleaned everything again. Same thing. Cleaned it for a third time, although this time I took my old TN820 cartridge (that I had replaced with the high yield one), and everything is working fine. So while you may think it's a better deal, if it doesn't produce what it says it will, then it's really isn't. I'll go back to using the TN820.
