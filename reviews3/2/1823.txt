Some people say they're well built, I guess compared to some consumer products, the plastic is cheesy and not reinforced, you can squeeze it and it flexes, I'm betting that someone will break one stepping on it or rolling over it with an office chair. At least it has 14ga wire which looks adequate.The bigger problem is if you intend to mount it to something. With remote learning going on I ended up building my kids an 8' long desk with their own divided spaces. I wanted to mount a power strip on each end so they each had places to plug in their laptops and other devices. First I looked at them and thought "well that's kind of dumb, one set of holes is almost in the middle of the back of the power strip (away from the cord end), I bet this is going to sag and be prone to falling off." I decided that I'll try it anyway when I realized that the way the screw slots in the back are shaped they are WAY too shallow for any screw head to go into them, and the piece of plastic inside it is shaped with a lip preventing anything from going into the slot end, and even if the slot wasn't too short to hold onto a screw head.If you intend to use screws to attach it to something, forget it, get a different power strip. If you intend to hang it vertically, switch/chord end down and use nails you _might_ be able to get away with this, but I suspect that you'll find that even hanging that way it will fall off.
