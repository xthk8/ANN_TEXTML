Honestly, for the price I was expecting something more DSLR-y. But what I got was a point-and-shoot that was buffed up to make it look like more than it is. Honestly when I picked it up out of the box I thought someone had scammed me. It feels like a kid's toy, a big hollow plastic camera. If not for the screen on the back, I think anyone could mistake it for that. It feels cheap and hollow inside. But okay never mind the feel, it's all about the pictures right. And the pictures are on the same level of a point and shoot too. I was prepared to give it a chance, despite my initial disappointment, until I saw the grainy low light pictures and the extremely poor dynamic range on the video. I was very impressed with the autofocus though for pictures, it was very speedy. Less impressed with the videos where it couldn't keep focus when I zoomed in.There are so many easy to access settings that provide those point and shoot features you'd expect, but it also allows you the more precise controls you'd expect from a better camera. The screen on the back is nice too. it's easy to hold when taking selfies, as long as you want to hold it with your left hand. For $200 less it would be a wonderful choice for a high quality point and shoot. And you might find it on sale for that price, And if you do I can recommend it. Maybe this camera is trying to fill that middle range between the two types of cameras.
