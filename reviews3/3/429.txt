I was gifted the wide printer so I purchased the film. Reminds me of the old polaroids which I am sorry I chucked years ago. The photo size is good but the film is too expensive to use it regularly so it makes it not a very good value. It comes across to me as more for kids. There are other printers on the market that I am checking out. Not a huge fan
