The thing I hate most about HP printers is the super-high cost of ink. One complete ink refill costs as much as the printer. And that refill lasts maybe two or three months of light use. It's pretty ridiculous. I would use third-party cartridges, but they have a spotty record of working or not working, and have been more trouble than they are worth. So there's really no way to win. All I can do is complain about the rock HP has me bent over.
