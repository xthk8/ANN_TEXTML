I'm a HUGE fan of budget Bluetooth headphones, especially sports earbuds!**The good:**+These are designed well,(nice and solid) and come with a nice compact carrying case, and offer great battery life.+They also sound very nice! They also support Bluetooth audio with the AAC codec, (not the highest quality, but a great choice for under $50)+Great connection quality! Stable connection no drop-outs, good range!But that's about where my praise ends,**The Bad**-Hybrid Noise canceling?I'm no stranger to cheap Active Noise Canceling (anc) headphones, they'll advertise a "90db drop! in noise", but that really means it lowers the volume, specially of low, constant, sounds. (such as a fan/ac/ PC noises)I don't know what I expected from these, background noise was reduced a bit, but that was far more from the 'passive noise-canceling' from heaving these properly sealed in your ears.Once I turned on the active noise-canceling feature, low background noise had an extremely moderate decrease. (I could barely tell it was on)-AI enhanced mic for calls?It would be interesting to see how you do 'AI processing locally on headphones this cheap,But regardless, they sound almost exactly the same as other (non-ai) bt earphones in the same price range.(Maybe they used an AI to preset the equalizer for them during manufacturing? IDK, add it to the list of misleading claims I guess)Transparency mode...In this mode, you could be able to more clearly hear background noises, such as cars, people, and other important things, however, this is more of a reverse-ANC, Where it just transfers and cranks up ANY background noise, I hope you don't have a fan near buy, because it will be SUPER loud in this mode,And much like Active Noise Canceling, this mode is non-adjustable.The ear tips:This is SUPER subjective, but even being a person who's tried over a dozen cheap head and earphones, (including other models from soundcore) these were some of the least comfortable I've found, I tried all three sizes, nothing fit right, and they easily fell out of my ears, despite following the instructions.I eventually found some tips from some older earphone and started using those.These were about the same size as the ones that shipped with these earphones, but they were a bit more solid, so they stayed in my ears better, and created a better seal.-USB charging on the bottom?Not a huge deal, But it make them harder to charge, as you can't have the case sitting up.If you prefer plugging in your case when it's low, then dropping in your earphone to charge at your leisure, you cant. It only charges when the case is on it's side, so you pretty much need to keep the case close while charging.----Tl;Dr:Would I recommend these?Maybe? If they're a good fit for you, and you can get them on-sale, as long as you don't need ANC, they're okay overall, and sounds pretty good!Even though I'm not the biggest fan of sound core's products, longevity (based on my previous SC headphones) at least the company support will replace them even if you have issues shortly after the 30 day window.So these are a MUCH better buy than no-brand earphones...But, if they're not on sale for $40 or less, you may as well go for something else
