I really, really, really tried to like the Pixel 7. Both my wife and I got Pixel 7s because of Google's update promise, the cameras, the Google apps, etc. Got off to a rocky start when our phones were stuck on the Nov 2022 update and we were into Feb.The thing that bugged me most about the phone, though, was the call audio. It's the worst call audio of any cell phone that I have owned. The problem was most noticeable when talking to someone on another Pixel 7 (like my wife has). The audio was distorted, with a sibilant hiss in the high frequencies. The microphone is extremely sensitive--my wife re-gripping the phone, repositioning her hand on the phone, changing her position while sitting down, etc would distort the audio. I was constantly having to ask her to repeat herself.The problem wasn't limited to the Pixel 7s, but also caused issues when talking to people on other cell phones and land-lines. Multiple people told me (unsolicited) that call audio from me was poor on their end.Google had put out a 'Clear Calling' update in Dec (which our phones hadn't gotten since we were stuck on the Nov updates). We were hoping that would clear up the audio issues. We finally got the update in Feb, but 'Clear Calling' didn't fix the issues. I'll probably return the Pixel and try another manufacturer.UPDATE: I returned the Pixel 7, and got a Samsung S22+, and have had no audio issues at all talking to my wife on her Pixel 7, which she kept. Driving to work, the Pixel would drop from 5G to 4G LTE in one area and the S22+ stays in 5G (at 3-bars out of 5).
