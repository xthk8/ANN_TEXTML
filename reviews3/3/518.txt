Â So, I ordered this camera on September 2, 2022; because I wanted to capture my rides on me electric scoot. First off, it's way overpriced. The image, no matter the resolution is lacking. The Image stabilization is serviceable but absolutely nothing to write home about. It handles daytime passably, the colors are way off and it's overblown. May be fixable to a degree in editing, but don't get your hopes up. It absolutely doesn't do nighttime, not at all. You can barely make anything out and generally pointless to use at night or lowlight.However, all that being said? If you're just looking for a camera to capture your bike, scoot, etc rides? It's good enough! It's still overpriced, but if you're not aiming for anything remotely useable.. it's a decent camera.
