Sony's Power Zoom 10-18 is a fine lens, but I prefer the newer 10-20 even without an image stabilizer.Truth be told, I accidentally ordered the 10-20 not knowing it was lacking image stabilization (I saw a deal and bought it too quickly). Once that lens arrived, I also ordered the 10-18 too so I could compare them. I hoped that the optical performance would be similar enough between the two that I could send back the 10-20 and keep the 10-18 for the image stabilization, however that was not the case.Comparing both lenses on my a6100 body, with both at 10mm and f/4, the 10-20 was the clear winner. While sharpness in the center was similar between the two, in the corners the 10-20 was much sharper. It also exhibited less purple fringing. I will miss the image stabilizer but high ISO on the a6100 is great, so I can deal with raising ISO when need be. Keep in mind, I am only comparing two samples and sharpness can vary from lens to lens.One thing that will not vary between samples is handling and the 10-20 just works better. The zoom mechanism is motorized but it is very smooth and able to move in fine increments. There is a slider and a barrel ring to choose from for zooming. Also the 10-20 has a customizable button and AF/MF switch, which the 10-18 does not. The barrel on the 10-20 does not extend, and the 10-18 is at the long end when the lens is retracted, so I have to remember to extend the lens for the widest view - which feels counterintuitive. Lastly, while the 10-20 is made of plastic, it feels rugged and robust and the slighter smaller size balances on the a6100 nicely.All in all... sharp, small, nice handling.
