I would never spend $1,000 on a drone even though the higher end ones are pretty nifty just not something I am into. For xmas my 9 year old grandson wanted a drone. We've had plenty of the $20 cheapos which work fine for a few months inside the house and then... Well you get what you pay for. This time I decided to spend a bit more. The Tello is a decent but expensive drone. Definitely better than the cheapos but for us it was disappointing in a different way. We had very little success flying it indoors. It needs more space than our 8' high ceilings and 12x24' living room could offer. Outside it did fairly well but the short battery life (10-15m) means you don't get much time before switching batteries. The control app on the ipad was laggy and hung up a couple of times.My grandson quickly lost interest and we went for a walk in the woods leaving the drone on the back porch. If you want something a little bit better than the cheapos this isn't a bad one to get. You get what you pay for.On the other hand I bought him a "Parrot MiniDrones Jumping Race Drone Max" for xmas four years ago. It is still going strong and his little brother plays with it all the time. "Max" has an honored place on a low shelf for him.
