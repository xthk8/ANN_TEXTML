The advertised genuine Brother toner boxes were opened and resealed. At first I thought they were recycled/refilled cartridges or Chinese knock offs, however, the Brother label was on the vacuum packages and on the toner cartridge itself. The prints seem to be OK. I found a stack of stickers in the boxes, so I'm not sure the boxes were opened to place them there, of if the cartridges were refilled and sealed.
