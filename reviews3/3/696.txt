(See updates) Well packed, no leaking, but the tone of the print is a sort of dreary grey. I expect nice, sharp black from genuine, premium toner, and this is not black, even on laser paper. My last Brother cartridge was only a bit more than half full (and Brother did not replace it), I will report back on the number of pages at the end of the cycle as well as make some comparison photos of the type quality and color with an aftermarket cartridge to see if it is darker.First update, August 2017: Unlike the original toner that came with the printer, which I'm guessing was defective, this cartridge has produced a solid number of prints. Towards the end of it's cycle, I'm not seeing visible signs of wear, which is a good thing. The print quality is still the dreary grey, as opposed to rich black, but it performing more or less as well as a new one. After I finish this cartridge, I will compare it to a $16 one, and we can see the difference.Second update: I ran this cartridge down to the end, I got about 6,500 pages from it. On the plus side, it printed well towards the end, with no significant difference from my sample sheet from the beginning of the run.I then replaced the cartridge with a generic one from Amazon:https://www.amazon.com/GREENSKY-Replacement-DCP-L5600DN-MFC-L5850DW-MFC-L5900DW/dp/B01IGT8QO8I then printed the same pages to compare the quality. There was no significant difference between the original Brother cartridge and the clone in terms of sharpness or toner scatter, but the clone was a bit blacker, some, but, not all of the grey was gone. The print output now looks more like my better laser printers. Note that I haven't tested all the the aftermarket cartridges, there may be better ones out there, this one was reasonably well rated.I will update the review in another 6,500 pages or so to see how long this cartridge lasts.
