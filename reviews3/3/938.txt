This is a solid product and really big, but it was still too small to completely fill my Zoom background unless it was right up behind my chair. Some of the photos show it like it would work behind two people in a side-by-side interview -- NOT GONNA HAPPEN !!!I don't know about other video call software, but Zoom's background detection has gotten good enough that this didn't make that big of a difference, really.It does not stand by itself, so you need something to hold or hang it up. If you are not up against a wall you will need some kind of rig. Hanging it from one tripod did not work, it just tipped over. You will need something with two sturdy stands on either side with a rod or line between them. For me, this was too much just for the daily stand-up Zoom call, so I sent it back.If you have trouble folding this, go to YouTube!! There are a dozen videos showing how to fold this up, find one that works for you. Folding it can be a bit knacky, but it's straightforward when you get the hang of it. HOWEVER, if you have mobility problems then PASS ON THIS. Folding it up is a whole-body experience.
