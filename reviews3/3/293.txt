After looking at some of the reviews about this product, I have to say this works with my Samsung Galaxy Tab S6.I picked this up due to the price nothing more, I use it for the so what images you may need at work. Also when I'm in the need to read something on the net and want to do a quick grab screen image(s). Now if you think of using this for a project or some event that's important to you. You should pay more for a product, but if you're like me and just need something because you may see something you like and may do some research then this is the product for you.
