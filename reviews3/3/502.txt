What I initially dislike about this product is that to connect them it keeps thinking that their AirPods, so it prompts you to make an option of continuing to connect or cancel. Also, I dislike that I just bought these and already only my right earbud works. I’m not sure if anyone is having the same issues that I am, but they are definitely cheaper than buying AirPods or AirPods Pro. If you got kids, they might be worth it before adults or for myself I’d rather invest a little more and have something long-term.
