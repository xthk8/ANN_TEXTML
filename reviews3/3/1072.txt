Ir'a currently holding up a Samsung 43 inch. It's not a beautiful thing. Kind of tinker toyish. But after a bunch of experimentation, I've got it set up so it works and be confident it will stay up there. Take a few rounds of rechecking tightness. Screws and nuts seemed to randomly loosen during the assembly process. Also note, that if you arrange the feet so the "short" leg is pointing forward, the TV will be dangerously tippy to the front. The long end of the feet seemed to have to face forward. OK for me as i had the room. But may not for everyone.e
