The cable is great to run along walls and minimize the visual impact. It's just unfortunate that the included clips are semi-permanent. If you ever wanted to swap out the cable but run it along the same route, you will need to remove the nails completely and re-hammer them into a different spot since nails aren't great when put into the same hole.
