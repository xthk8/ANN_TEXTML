It gets the job done, but it’s not super user friendly. You can’t use Apple CarPlay at the same time and have it record. It says it’s always recording, but when I go into the app the recordings are blank unless I turn off Apple CarPlay. Even when I connect to the camera WiFi later, the recordings are still showing blank. It’s not the memory card because I’ve tried a couple and formatted them… it has to do with the WiFi and connection to the camera.The only way to easily record and view videos is to turn off Apple CarPlay.I’d return it and get something else but I already threw away the box.
