We purchased this telescope for a Christmas gift. The telescope overall seems to have nice power and quality to it, but the mount is terrible. After finding an object and adjusting the scope precisely to view it, the scope sags as soon as you let go of it. We have tried making the adjustment knobs tighter, but are afraid they will break off if tightened any farther. They seem flimsy and not strong enough to maintain the weight of the scope, which isn't very heavy. The tripod, is a travel style, lightweight and flimsy. If you wan't something study to hold your scope, this is not it. Also, noticed when we changed the eyepice, the set-screw is stripped and does nothing. We are deciding between trying to get a replacement eye-piece holder and sturdy tripod or returning the scope altogether.Update, we finally figured out how to adjust the mount so that it doesn't sag, instead it now moves slightly upwards as the handle is twisted to lock it into place. We have also decided to use the scope on the tripod, but place it on a table rather than extend the legs, so it isn't so wobbly.
