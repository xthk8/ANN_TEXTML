I bought this because people claimed it's the lightest gimbal at 0.9 kg - but that's without even the most basic attachments like the quick release plate! After adding everything except the transmitter and focus motor it's 1.3 kg, same as the DJI compact 2 & 3. If I had known that I would have got the DJI instead. The axis lock sliders should all be on the same side as well and the amount of play when it's all locked up is too much to use it as an extension pole, you'll have to release the camera from with the quick release plate which may have the focus motor still attached. Basically you can't release the camera and shoot handheld - you have to remove the quick release plate and everything attached to it as well. Not the best designed.
