I tried so hard to get the SmartSense program to work to no avail. Read several Youtube videos, etc. It loaded fine on my Iphone12, and appears to be a nice program. However it would never point in the right direction. I made sure it was properly aligned with the mirror, but everything I tried made it worse. As a retired NASA Space Flight Dynamics engineer, I am disappointed, and have returned the Scope. Amazon was great as always in standing by what they sell and refunded my money upon return.
