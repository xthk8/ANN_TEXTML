I researched portable waterproof blue tooth speakers and ended up trialing both the Earfun UBOOM L and the Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM 3. I kept the Earfun because the sound was fuller, had better base to fill out the sound, the volume controls were much easier to use, it had a microphone so it could be used as a speakerphone and the price was $20 less than the Ultimate Ears. Tho the Ultimate Ears had higher ratings for "clarity of sound", I found a couple problems with it: 1. The "clarity" of sound that was touted by reviews, including Wirecutter, sounded shrill and hollow due to lack of bass to support and pull the music together. 2. The volume on the Ultimate Ears was controlled by funky + and - symbols on the front of the speaker and were hard to use without holding the speaker with a second hand, making it difficult to change volume at night with lights off and lying in bed. 3. The Ultimate Ears has no microphone so it can't also be used with your phone as a speakerphone. 4. The Ultimate Ears costs $20 more but you get so much less compared to the Earfun. Hands down, the Earfun UBOOM L is a better speaker, better sound, better volume controls and better price.
