Overall a good headset with the exception of one item - sound volume control. The headset is suppose to have an increase / decrease volume control. So far I have had two units (sent the first one back after discussing with Poly and they declared there was an issue) and both have had no control on volume with the headset controls. So far I've only been able to increase or decrease the volume via the base unit dial (which is on the underside of the base unit so not practical to use as some people talk loud and other soft). After experiencing it with two units, it seems like they either had a really bad manufacturing run or the volume control just doesn't work. Sound is clear, mute button works (would be nice to have an indicator on the headset when the mute is on since you are not always near the base unit). So far the distance from the base unit has been good. Sound is clear. Only complaint is the headset volume control does nothing, doesn't work.
