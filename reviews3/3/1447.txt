The sound quality is good, and people can hear me much better than when I use the microphone and speaker on my laptop. The problem is that you can't turn off the stupid voice prompts. You can mute some of them, but for some reason you can't mute all of them. This is a problem because every single time you shut down, or hibernate, or restart, it starts telling you how to connect to Bluetooth. It's an annoying voice, and it's telling me something I don't need to know, but Jabra has decided that for some reason you can't mute this annoying prompt. The odd thing is that it seems to do it randomly as well. I've shutdown my computer, and then two hours later the thing starts going on about Bluetooth again. I've had it do this in the middle of the night as well. Overall this is a good product, with a bad user experience.
