I ordered these a year ago to help with my loud upstairs neighbors/poor apartment soundproofing. They worked well enough for me not to be chronically sleep deprived. Although there were quite a bit of cons, they far exceeded my expectations for a $20 pair of sleep headphones. I'll be purchasing a different brand to compare, but I will likely buy these again.PROS:â€¢ Cheap.â€¢ Easy to use.â€¢ Lasted a YEAR. Only replaced because of a very light crackling noise when playing high volume (high volume is needed to block anything)â€¢ Better solution than needlessly complaining about neighbors.CONS:â€¢ Insanely loud voice announcements, including "incoming call" announcements that go off regardless of your phone's do not disturb status. Really annoying to be woken up by spam calls.â€¢ Noise cancelation is garbage. Loud noises would still wake me up. It's best for white noise and soothing.â€¢ Pretty uncomfortable for side sleepers due to how bulky the speakers are and the lack of padding in that area. Also uncomfortable where the battery/controller sits and gives pressure headaches.â€¢ Did I mention the LOUD voice narration? Yeah, get ready to wince when you turn these bad boys on. You don't need to guess if they're on, they'll let you know.ProCons (can't tell which?):â€¢ Have you ever wanted to turn your room into a disco? Well, this product will NOT disappoint. You get a nice high-quality blue power indicator that'll light up your room in no time.â€¢ Do you love routine and schedules? No? Well, learn to love it because these babies LOVE a routine. If you don't charge them every night for at least 1.5-2 hours, enjoy your night without your white noise.â€¢ Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have a sauna - in bed?! Look no further. These mamajammas are HOT. You'll be sweating in no time. ðŸ¥µ
