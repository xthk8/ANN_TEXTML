Sadly this device simply isn't fit for the Samsung Fold phones. With the thinnest case available the USB-C still cannot reach the port. With no case it works, but the fit is loose, and one wrong bump could lead to the USB-C plug breaking off in the port of your phone due to the angle of the controller on the phone and pressure it puts on the joint when the phone shifts around.Reason why I left 3 stars is because the product itself works, but their design has excluded users based on their phone's dimensions with no way to augment or alter the controller for a better fit.
