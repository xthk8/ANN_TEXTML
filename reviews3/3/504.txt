Â So overall the pen kinda works. I do want to preface this and say I tested this on both my phone (Note 10+) and a 2018 Samsung Tablet, Results were the same on both devices, and I also tested it against the Samsung S-Pen. I also only used the tip of the pen and not the soft additional cap for my tests, as I hardly use that myself.The pen came charged out of box, so that was great, and I got straight into drawing with it.(It does come with a Micro USB charger for when you do need to charge it) it comes with 2 caps to cover up the charging port, and they both magnetically stay on the pen, the first one is plain, and the second one has a soft tip on it, which you can also use for drawing or writing.The pen was a bit heavy at first, but after using it you get used to it a little. Its not uncomfortable to hold, it just feels like a normal pencil with just a bit of weight added on.So starting off the review, I have noticed that the pen does shut off by itself every 10 or 15 minutes, which can be a little confusing when drawing, and you have to remember to click the power button and turn it back on and you're good to go. Its a little annoying, but I can deal with that. I do also want to mention that there is NO tilt support or palm rejection, this is stated in the description but I figured I would mention it in case someone didn't read that part. There is also no "touchpad" like the apple pencil where you can double tap the body of the pen to undo an action or to swap brushes or anything like that, this is just a basic stylus.CONS:- The next thing I would like to touch on is that when drawing diagonal lines, there is a ton of jitter (see photo and video attached) I tried drawing the lines super slow, then at a medium pace and a quick pace, and they only started to go away when drawing quicker. This can be very frustrating when you're trying to draw something slowly and theres no way you can fix that jitter. I even tried drawing those diagonal lines along a ruler to take away most of my hands natural shake, and the jitter is still present when making those lines.- I also noticed that there is some pen lag when drawing as well, which I guess is expected with a cheaper stylus.- That being said, writing with this pen is a NIGHTMARE (see video) the pen is all over the place, lagging behind and jumping forward. Its just no good period. I would not reccomend this to any note takers for this reason.PROS:- The pen works- The fine tip is excellent, I can't stand how most styluses have that clear flexible disc on the tip, it makes it nearly impossible to see what you're drawing, so the fine tip on this is Excellent!- Its rechargeable and theres no need to connect to your device via Bluetooth, it just works once you turn it on.- It works for most coloring/painting needsI hope I managed to include everything in this review, you can check out my photo and video linked to see how the pen performs against the S-pen ( the stylus that came included with my Note 10+ phone )If you do get this pen and things don't work out the best, its okay, dont be discouraged, everything takes practice and getting used to, this pen may not work for you and thats okay, im sure you will find one that will, you may need to save up to buy a higher quality pen, but if you're just looking to get started with something, I'd say try it out, its on the lover end, but it can definitely work. I also definitely reccoment getting a screen protector for the device you use this with just to be on the safe side, I havent noticed any scratching on my phone or tablet, but it certainly wouldn't hurt to have the additional layer of protection for your device ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’™
