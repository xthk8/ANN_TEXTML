We bought this for our trip to Ireland in June 2021. I lost the charger in my bag (later found) and was unable to keep the batteries full so when it died we switched to my husband's phone for a few days. When we got home and downloaded all of our pictures from all sources we were so surprised and disappointed that my husband's phone took better, clearer pictures than this camera. So when we went away again in August 2022 we left this thing at home.
