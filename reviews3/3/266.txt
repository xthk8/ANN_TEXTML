Overall it seems to be recording well and everything seems to be working now. But fresh out of the box two big problems. The first is that you'll soon see that you need your own cables to connect a VCR to the cables sold with this package. It would have cost them very little to have the appropriate cables in there but instead you need to order them. Nowadays few people will have those lying around already. The other big complaint is that I downloaded the software that they said onto my brand new PC computer with latest operating system. Then as soon as you try to run it it tells you that's out of date and you need to download a new one. And there are all sorts of security problems with downloading the new one and it first the old one doesn't want to run either until you redo your security settings. But after doing that and restarting my computer and ignoring the update it seems to be working okay. But for goodness sakes, I have no idea why they wouldn't have the latest software to download on their download page! And the security problems, you think they could figure that one out. But once you get through that it's relatively easy to record whatever you want to play on your VCR
