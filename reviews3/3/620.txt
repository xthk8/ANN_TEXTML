The CB radio itself has been fantastic. Works very well plowing snow on the Interstate. Up until this year 2023, everything has been working just swell. About two weeks ago, a coworker buddy of mine had his radio start to give him fits. It wouldn't key out. After some troubleshooting, it was determined that the key out button linkage to the electrical switch inside the microphone has a manufacturers defect. A piece of plastic wore and one part the was supposed to engage another part slipped under the linkage instead of pushing on it. Then, other pivot parts, all plastic, were found to be sheared off inside. Microphone was never subjected to abuse, just use, and it died. Now my microphone is exhibiting the same symptoms. It is starting to not key out consistently when the button is pressed. Sometimes it keys out, sometimes it doesn't. Nothing more frustrating than trying to discuss a lane transition plan with a plowing partner and they keep asking "can you hear me" and you hear them fine, but the stupid microphone will not key out. Buyer be warned. They aren't cheap to buy either. I mean sure, Uniden could offer me a replacement...but why bother, unless they have identified and corrected a defect, you'll likely just be in an important use scenario and the microphone just gives up on you. Sad. So sink of manufacturers making crap products, or crap components. You put your name on this thing Uniden...you own this. "Good job" in design and quality control. Astatic replacment on order.
