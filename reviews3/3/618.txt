I bought this to put on an '07 super duty diesel. then come to find out I had to order a whole separate programmer just to make it work for a diesel! within 3 weeks after installing it, my remote/pager unit began to malfunction constantly and would just start vibrating and beeping in the middle of the night for no reason and then turn off and then a couple days later turn itself back on randomly and it keeps drawing so much power from the battery. it keeps getting corrosion inside of it sitting inside the house. I could only use the backup remote! I try to get a hold of somebody for a warranty and can't get a hold of anybody and a whole new remote is 70 bucks which I feel like I should have a warranty on seeing that the product was that new.
