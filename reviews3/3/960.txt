**GOT IT WORKING NOT GUARANTEED BUT MAY HELP** Read the reviews and was getting issues of needing to download app with QR code did this but still wasnâ€™t working with app they suggested. Had to update my iPhone to latest iOS and this seemed to help me. Still a bit buggy but some what usable but guess you get what you pay for.
