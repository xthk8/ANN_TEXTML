I wanted an high quality watch band that made my apple watch look like a G-Shock. It does provide the look and feel. It is a great green color but where the band contacts the skin it tends to discolor to a yellowish green pretty quickly. The material is a bi stiff upon getting it so it can feel a bit uncomfortable at first. However, it does soften up rather quickly and after a couple of days you cannot even tell you are wearing it. They offer the ability to get different watch faces but the app and the interactivity is very cumbersome and not worth the effort to get the new face onto the apple watch.
