With the standard settings on this camera I can still see blurring and JPG compression artefacts in both the front-facing stills and 360 images and videos.The worst thing is the intrusive software. The mobile apps are OK but you will get spammed for further purchases when you least expect it - when you want to take a picture! The desktop apps are equally bad. They are used to load media from the camera to your computer. Many people have reported an inability to download them at all. You certainly cannot download them without logging in with an email to either the Microsoft or Apple stores.
