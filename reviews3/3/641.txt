This is the 2nd time i buy these....because well i had them in the case...and the case wasn't a smooth seal fit like it shows in the pictures (trust me i made sure i had it push in fully...false advertisement? faulty case?...any ways that's a different story on to the product review.Our Company was looking to upgrade from The old Foam ear plugs and ear muff like designs (walkers werent a option due to other ppe) mainly for our Production and Engineering team we looked at a few options and came to a few must haves like :* Noise Canceling but a option for some sort of "alert" or Ambient sound option , in this case the Products Transparency Mode**water / Sweat resistance IP6+**At least 4 hours on a single charge - since staff can sneak in a charge during their breaks (15 + 30 + 15 + plus any down time they might have out of the production area and when they are in the office**Due to loud noise /Environment we figure it should be Bluetooth and paired to their phones to make communicating even better when the engineers were running diagnostics - Check basically don't need to shell out for walkies... and just add a incentive*Protective Case for the buds Charging Case preferably sold by the buds manufacturer to avoid product flaws with the case [not fitting or incompatible, cheap quality etc] * - check....but mines was Very...small it fit the charging case but not fully like shown in the Amazon pictures (basically like fitting into pants and your gut hanging out, case also didn't have a sort of latch to secure the charging case from opening unintentionally*Protective case with a latch to keep the charging case secure and avoid it from falling out and get damaged or lost* - Failed - looked good on site but upon arrival it had no sort of "Latch" to secure it shut , and the protective Case did not fully secure over the entire Charging case**Protection over the charging port or wireless Alternative* - PASS/FailProduct failed because even with the protective Case it did not cover the Charging Port at the rear of the Buds Charging Case, our concern was charging issues down the line as the port would get filled with dust and fine powders (something we have noticed with the company phones making their handheld use restricted more to speakerphones)Product Passed and went on for Testing thanks to it Wireless charging option for the case*Easy cleaning the goal to easily clean the buds and inside the case to keep it free of dusts and Powders* Product did decently I'd say 3.5 out of 5 due to the mentioned "Exposed" Charging Port long as the case still stays closed we noticed no Dust or powder made it's way fully inside just on the outer edges of the case.*Option to display Battery life on the device or case - not required but a nice option* Fail /Nay this device has no option that displays the battery level of the buds on your phone or on the case but i have seen they have another model that does(shame there is no way to compare the differences between the products)Now the personal Review- i submitted my feed back , and figured i do the same hereEarbuds size are nice and compact, you notice them but they aren't a Burden.Both Buds also have the Bluetooth antenna...or what not so if you want to use one bud you aren't restricted to using a specific side (in my experience with older brands only one bud would have it forcing you to use that side , - sony and ankers case it was the right Bud, you couldn't use the left Bud solo as it automatically tried looking for the right bud and was unable to connect to your phoneEarbud texture and quality- have tried different earbuds for personal use (Anker , Sony , Bose , Beats, airpods, Samsung etc) each brand tends to have their gimmick / Design signature, Ear buds are of a smooth plastic, and i thought it was great until the Right Earbud cut my the inner bit of my ear, i took it off and confirmed , a bit of the plastic frame where the ends meet was kinda sharp had to...well sand it down a bit until it felt smooth (i think it probably should of been removed during manufacturing since it was a bit protruding)Water /sweat Resistance- no complaints it looks like it worked perfectly fineSound Quality is pretty nice although i had calls seem to be choppy where it looks the it cut off the call this could be user/ Device error on my end or the callers.Transparency Mode - it works pretty great good for drowning out loud noise but leave out the important noise like... back up chimes, Horns and machineryNC - Noise Canceling quality is pretty goodEarbud Charging/Storage protective case - Bought the Protective case that wraps around the earbuds charging/storage case and immediately saw it didn't fit , i ensured it had no slack so the case was smaller and didn't fully wrap around the case like the photos advertise on the items page, it also leaves the charging port exposed to pick up lint and other stuff from your pocket and surrounds, since i work in a environment where the work area is dusty...i kept that in mind.Well yesterday i had the Right earbud in and the left bud in the case in the protective case clipped onto my belt loop...and it fell outThen the Remaining ear bud broke in the area where it holds the silicone bud when i was trying to swap it out for a bigger sizeHave now learned my lesson...to keep it in my pocket could be it was defective...sadly had to buy a 2nd since it's cheap priced for the quality....literally about $20 to $40 bucks more than the similar or almost similar like earbuds you find at retail stores like Marshalls, Tj max etcHopefully the review is able to help some people out and i be sure to post a update with the 2nd Pair (purchased the exact same with the case again,
