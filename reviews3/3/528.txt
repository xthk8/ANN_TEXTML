I bought this camera and a second stationary camera from Wyze to be able to monitor my house. This one I would not buy again. While everything works well on it, it constantly "loses connection". I've had it lose it's connection while I'm watching it, when it was working five minutes beforehand, at random times. It makes it really frustrating or unable to use when you're not at home - which is the point. I would definitely buy a stationary one again, but I wouldn't spend the extra money on this one.
