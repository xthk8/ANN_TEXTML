I bought this for my pc thinking I would be able to extend my displays because I always use two monitors, but my PC only has one HDMI port. Found out this thing only duplicates the displays. Personally I don’t know why anyone would need this except for some niche areas, but even so the cord is so short that if you wanted two duplicated screens far away from one another or something you’d have to get a special long cable anyway. So it works (ish) but it’s not what I had been expecting.
