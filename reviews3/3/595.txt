For what it is, this is a nice light. LumeCube makes quality products and this is no exception. It feels well-made and the light quality is excellent for a light of this size and in this price range.I find myself using it at around 45-50% power for video conferences. This seems really bright, but at the distance most folks sit from a laptop, you need more than you might think. After being fully charged, I just used it for an hour, and was down to about 50 minutes of expected life at that level.That's not great, but it charges fairly fast, and can charge while in use. That's issue 1. Issue 2 is a somewhat weird one, to the extent that I wonder if my unit is defective: It will ONLY charge using the included USB-A to USB-C cord. I use almost exclusively USB-C these days, so I figured I could plug it into any USB-C cord/charging block and it would work fine. Nope. I've used cords and charging blocks from 3 different brands (and 4 different power outputs: 18W, 60W, 65W, and 87W), and nothing will will work except the original included A-to-C cord. I've never seen a product that had this issue. It would seem like it's not a huge deal, but it means carrying around an extra charging block and cord just for this one small product, particularly because the battery life isn't great. This past week I left the office in a hurry and forgot this one cord, and so I couldn't use the light after it went dead.It's not worth returning over, but if I'd known this I'd have probably gone with a different brand.
