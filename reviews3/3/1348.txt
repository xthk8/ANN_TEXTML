I wish I would have received all four items in working condition, but unfortunately the red one came with a broken snap closure. The rest seem to be sturdy enough after opening and closing a few times, so I’m hopeful we just got one bad one in the batch. I’d like a replacement without the trouble of having to send all four back, however.
