This review is for the Optoma HZ39HDR.On paper this projector checked all my boxes. It is a gaming projector with low input-lag, it has 4000 lumens of brightness for ambient-light viewing, and it runs on a laser source for full-on years of projectory goodness. All from industry-standard Optoma for $1199 (My price).The sad reality is that compromises had to be made. It seems that way. I've sent back two of these now, and have jumped ship.Both projectors featured focus uniformity issues. This means the entire image can't be in focus at once.On my first projector I found that If I focused the bottom middle of the image, the top right corner would come out of focus, and vice versa. I tested in multiple environments. To top it off, the right side of the projector bled green around the white pixels, giving it a hue. Given a balance between the focus areas, and during most content, this was fine. But it bothered me, so I replaced it.The second projector had much better uniform focus (top left corner this time, but not as bad). However, the entire image had a twist upward and a curving slant. Once again, tested in multiple environments. This made it near impossible to center on a screen. The lower right edge bled yellow and faded on any white-centric scene. Unacceptable. It went back as well.At this price-point a little research will show you that lens manufacturing issues are varied and common. They may not bother you.Both projectors could display down-scaled 4k input on their 1080P native with absolute beauty. Both generally looked fine. Motion was smooth in games and color was acceptable. Brightness was certainly suitable for some ambient light.Perhaps these issues wouldn't be deal-breakers for you. I give it 3 stars. This is still one of the cheapest ways to get the long-lasting might of a Laser projector, and is perhaps the only gaming laser projector available (aside from its short-throw cousin).Simply be advised of its potential flaws before buying.
