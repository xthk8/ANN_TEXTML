When you have a case around your phone, (I have a soft case around my iPhone) that little plug won’t hardly come out the phone when you’re done charging. I literally have to either pull it out with scissors or take the case off and then it comes out when I do that.Big design flaw as far as I’m concerned. I haven’t decided yet if I’m going to keep these or not. It’s only been one day. I found out in the morning it didn’t charge my phone at all because the plug didn’t go in the phone far enough apparently possibly, because of the case. But most people have a case around their phone. It also does not fast charge.
