Purchased this to record my daughter's club and high school basketball games. Here's what I've noticed so far.When you connect the camera to your computer and put it into USB mode, it will not be recognized natively on a Mac. In order to pull the videos, I've had to install a VM running Windows 10. Then I can copy videos to an external drive that can be read in both Mac and Windows. So that's something to keep in mind if you're a Mac user.It comes with a remote, but mine doesn't seem to work. I have to use the zoom feature on the camera while trying to pan back and forth which at times, degrades the video quality. So there's that.Battery life is decent, although during Easter weekend, I swapped out the batteries and the camera kept displaying that the battery was low, even though it should have been fully charged. Even after turning the camera off and on, it still kept displaying a low battery icon.Also keep in mind that the camera will only support 128 GB SD card. The good news is that if you leave the camera at the default 30 FPS, you can record up to 8 hours of video (the quality to me is not HD at all...so there's that, too).I've yet to try the night vision feature, so I can't offer any insight on that. There's no touch screen feature, so not sure why Amazon has a rating for that feature.Overall, the camera does what I need it to do (for now), so keeping those things in mind listed above, I give it a solid 3 stars.
