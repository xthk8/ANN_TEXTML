This product is not very stable, the "legs" of the stand are not very sturdy and move around a lot. It tends to fall over and it moves easily, i was let down even though my ecxpectations were low from the start. If you're thinking of buying this I'd recommend looking for a product with better "legs" that are sturdier :)
