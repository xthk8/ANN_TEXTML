So I’ve had this product for almost a month now and while I really love the sound that comes from these headphones, without even turning the volume up half way, there is leaked sound.I wore them next to a family member and tested the limits of what volume she could hear noise from and it really differed from each song/was not consistent. This test was conducted in a car, which is pretty close quarters, which just shows you how far away you have to be for the sound to be leaked.While this wouldn’t really be an issue if I didn’t have to be around people, but the #2 reason why I bought these was for airplane use. I’m afraid that I will not be able to turn the volume enough to tune out the plane & people without the fear of bugging the people around me.If you are bolder than me and do not care if those around you can hear your music in closer proximity, just spend the $40 and get them.There is one other downside to these headphones that has occurred to me about 4 times already which is that they will randomly shut down. Even with enough battery and a strong Bluetooth connection, this has happened to me. Not the biggest dealbreaker for the mere $40 I paid for them, but it can be very annoying, especially when I am wearing them to have distance from my phone then have to go fetch my phone to restart everything.With this being said, there is a chance I just got a bad pair. I am still debating on keeping them or returning them, but honestly these headphones do get the job done. I bought the blue ones and I will say they are a beautiful shade and just what I originally was looking for in terms of aesthetic.
