You cannot see diddly in the day, even with the “screen” they send with it. You need a real screen for daytime use which is such a bummer. I like the size. The fan however is noisy. Adding Bluetooth would be great if you do not mind the audio lag. It is really bad. I hate watch shows with people speaking different languages and this is worse when on Bluetooth the people speak and then the mouths move. It’s always been a pet peeve so I would not have gotten it based on lacking audio quality alone. Then having to only be able to view at night defeats the purpose I had of working yet having school notes on my wall while studying for my doctorate. And it’s glitchy lately. I get static on it and haven’t been able to successfully use the screen mirror feature. The ratings were so good. Maybe I got a dud? I do not have a TV so I am stuck with it or having nothing at the money since budgets are tight. For a budget projector and the rating I saw I was really hoping for a good product.
