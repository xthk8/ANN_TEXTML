Everything about this camera is great. Except the recording time. Even when paying for a business license on their cloud service, (Basic was free btw which is great), you only get 8 seconds recording once the motion is triggered.If I needed a trail camera to watch animals, this would be great. to protect a remote section of my business, not so great, I need recoding from motion start to stop.No where in the product description, here or on the company's website, is this 8 second limit mentioned. Only once you realize the size of the recording and google it, do you get directed to the support page.
