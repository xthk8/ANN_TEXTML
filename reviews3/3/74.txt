Poor and incomplete user manual. I still have not used the camera for pictures or video. Will comment later on how well it takes pictures . Did find out that the USB connector to the camera is very poor quality and resists insertion. I am not sure that the charge indicator is displaying correctly, is presently all blank and I was expecting it to be all black when fully charged. Will comment more later after taking some pictures.
