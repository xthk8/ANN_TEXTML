I got these because my monitors were disconnecting/reconnecting/flashing when I stand up from my office chair (due to electrostatic discharge) and was told that installing these will stop these from happening. I could not say with confidence if these made a significant difference, because the flashing still happens, although perhaps with less frequency. This is also possibly because I have started to spray my chair with Downy (which seemed to have made the most difference), but nonetheless installing these EMI blockers onto all the HDMI ends were not sufficient to prevent these issues 100%, so I am not sure if I can recommend them with confidence (even though they are very cheap).
