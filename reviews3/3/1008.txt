I am happy enough with these cables. I haven’t measured them but they seem to be 10 feet. I don’t expect them to last very long though. They feel fairly rigid so I suspect the cable will break near the plug, which is where most of my cables break.I didn’t measure it but it seems like my phone isn’t charging as fast with these cables either.
