I had this idea of what this lens would do but it's not exactly that. Does it work as intended? Yes it does. Why did I give it 3 stars? For not advertising it like the should have. This lens is a must have mod for the average Jane or Joe so they can walk around with their camera on vacation and come home with beautiful footage. It is not for people like me trying to get a wide angle lens for 5k photography.Now, the mount for the lens was so hard to get on I literally used an adjustable wrench! Yeah, that bad. I should give it 1 star but the worry free, effortless family vacation footage it produces is stunning. It's like you hired a professional to follow you around but in truth you walked around with it on a stick. How crazy is that? Fix the mount, GoPro!UPDATE: over time the lens does wear in and putting it on and taking it off does get considerably easier. The footage this lens takes though can be breathtaking. I wish it had higher final resolution though. The nearly perfect footage could replace cranes and steadycams for a fraction of the effort.
