I bought 2 of these. I put one in my purse and another on a sports equipment item in the garage. Sometimes in driving to another city it would not report my intermediate locations. Maybe one in 60 miles and I would assume in a populated area the updates of places I went would appear more often (such as going into a restaurant, a gas station, someone's house, etc.). After 2 months the tag on the sports equipment said it was too low to be effective anymore and it took 3 months for the one in my purse to fail as well. I read one review here that said this might be a firmware or software problem and he occasionally would reset his tag and it would again report adequate battery life. This would be a deal breaker if you didn't have the tag with you when this happened! What if it was in your lost luggage and the battery either died, or the tag thought the battery was too low to report the location??? If Apple can figure this out with their AirTag why cant Samsung? The problem seems to rely on the fact that locations are reported using Samsung phones that are nearby the tag and there are just a whole lot more Apple iPhones out there than Samsung Galaxy. If you want to rely on this for travel, preventing theft and lost luggage it may or may not work.
