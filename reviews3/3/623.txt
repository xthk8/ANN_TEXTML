Tried it both ways, but the placement of the spheres on the center section don't allow you to install this phone holder with a 90° angle, let alone more.In my case, I want to stick the base UNDER something, and then ideally angle the phone UP a bit. The maximum it will do with this one is angle the phone slightly DOWN, which doesn't work for me.A simple redesign of the center section, where the spheres are set on a STRAIGHT but narrow piece, would allow the base and the magnet to move around a lot more, and have way better angles.PS: I tried both ways, but the placement in the photo was the closest I got to getting 90°
