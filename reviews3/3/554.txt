I call this lens the 'iffy fifty', since the odds of shooting any keepers with it are iffy at best. Needless to say, I returned this lens the very next day.I got this lens for my Canon R10, which does not have in body stabilization. This being a fast lens, I didn't it would be a big deal. But I was wrong.But that's not the only issue, nor is it the biggest. Autofocus with this lens is absolutely atrocious. Not only is it incredibly slow (like unbelievably slow), but it really struggles to focus on anything at all. I missed so many great shots because this lens simply either refused to focus at all, or couldn't maintain focus for some unknown reason.During the day that I owned this lens I shot in a variety of lighting conditions, including bright, full sun, midday daylight, indoor daytime with lights on, and at night with studio lights on. Using this lens without any artificial light source indoors was a complete fail. Even with studio lights, this lens failed to live up to the hype in a very big way.I shot maybe about a 100 photos throughout the course of a day, and out of those I only have two mediocre 'keepers'. And those two 'keepers'I could have easily shot with the 14-45mm kit lens that came with the R10. I mean yeah, the bokeh wouldn't be quite as creamy as it is with the 'iffy fifty', but the focus would be tack sharp, something that the 'iffy fifty' just couldn't provide.Most R series cameras have IBIS, so its possible that the issues that I experienced don't present themselves for a vast majority of 'iffy fifty' owners. Either way, I sent it back with a quickness. Total waste of time and money. The hype around this lens is absolutely mind boggling. Can't imagine IBIS making enough of a difference to redeem this lens. PASS.
