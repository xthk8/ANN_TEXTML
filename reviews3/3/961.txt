I bought this as my vehicle has an HDMI plug in it for the screen and from what I researched I should be able to play movies from my phone on it when parked and not driving but I could not get it to work. Not sure if it was my iPhone or car or cable being the issue but everything per my research online should have let this work. That being said the cable seemed like it was made from quality material and a decent gauge wire and sturdy plugs on both the HDMI and lightning side. Might work for your needs on a home entertainment system inside but did not work on my Honda HR-V.
