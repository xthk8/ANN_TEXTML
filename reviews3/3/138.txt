I got confused and bough it.....Why its not a wifi plug WITH a usb output port???First, you need to have ONLY a Cam V3 connected to interact with it. Not sure why Wyze didnt design it so it could be a stand alone product that could also be controlled through any Wyze cam. Its functionality is limited.I tough I could use it on my garage to simply voice command it using Alexa (thought Wyze app linkage). Then, when wanted, add a Wyze cam outside the garage and power it through a usb cable connected to it. There is no need to turn the light on if the cam has a color night vision feature that works awesome. But I understand some people may want that feature while others dont. So why not just simply enable/disable the function on the app? Who knows. According to others, the socket become smart ONLY when the Wyze cam V3 is connected on it. Otherwise is just a dumb regular socket adapted.Hello Mr Wyze.... Design one that CAN be used to power any cam but that it gets enhanced if you decide to add a Wyze cam (Any model) and that the socket itself can be used as a Wifi connector for dumb bulbs.So far, it seems to me this one may be returned.
