I really enjoyed it, I used it bedside for one year. The length is best to hold a device at eye level beside the bed, but it's not really long enough to reach over the bed if you prefer it directly in front of you. I bought this 11/2021 and it broke today 11/28/2022. It was great while it lasted, held my phone every night. I expected this to last longer under daily light use, but might buy again for the convenience it offers. Something inside of the base gave away, so the sturdiness is no longer there.
