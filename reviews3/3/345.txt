These are really good but there are 3 negatives from my experience influencing my decision to 3 star my review.1: can't use a case with them, if you're using a case it does start to become annoying removing it evertime want to use backbone then putting back on, would be perfect for naked phone users or using a sleeve pouch instead of a case, but I like keeping my gripzilla case on my iphone personally, kinda nitpicky but it is what it is.2: not sure if it's my misfortune but first one had an overly loose loud clicky r2 button and same with it's replacement, not as bad as first but replacement also had wierd powdery stuff on it & box was everywhere, kinda looked like baby powder along with faultyish r2, if it isn't my roll of the dice then something's up at the assembly line where it's made, don't think I'll be replacing again twice is enough, other than those issues it felt more premium than the rest of it's competition & would of kept otherwise, felt so good using it to, bummer.3: the app isn't free & they basically want playstation plus prices to use it, not justified in my opinion after the 100$ price tag, playstation plus atleast offers free monthly games whereas the only thing backbone app offers is convenience, kinda pricey convenience tax, can be used without the app but it is a waste because the app is decent for sure.Final thoughts: If you're going to spend premium price for a mobile controller I recommend it for naked phone users for sure, I myself being a case user prefer the gamevice flex, flex app not as good as the backbone app but it is free, flex feels not as premium as backbone but 1/1 defect free for me & felt good in the hands, very customizable for case users & I like the analogs better on flex, it grew on me you could say more than the backbone pretty much, I do like the backbone's back more than the flex though.Hope this review is helpful for case users on the fence, pro tip: can use joycon thumb caps on both backbone & flex, analogs felt better for me with those on, especially on the backbone, isn't necessary but kinda nice for the thumbs. Ones I used were the skull and co ones for joycons, not sure how other brands fit but should fit all the same probably.
