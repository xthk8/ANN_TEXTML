I have been using this almost regularly for over a week now for my cracked feet . It’s convenient to use as it’s a roll on stick and does not make hands messy when applying. Reason why I would continue to use it. However it only softens skin a little bit , it’s not as powerful as petroleum jelly . Even after using it regularly after a bath and covering my feet with socks my cracked feet haven’t healed completely. It only soften my cracked feet temporarily.I would continue to use this but it’s definitely not a solution for cracked feet . Just another moisturizer for me !
