It does its job by duplicating the monitor images as I wanted BUT because I don’t have the same sized monitors the 2nd screen AND 3rd screen shrinks the image from the main source. I wanted to try to connect my monitor and display drawing tablet at my laptop at the same time but it doesn’t work :(I’ll give it about 3 stars for trying its best
