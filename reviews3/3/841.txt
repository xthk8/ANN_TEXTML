Of the 5 or so rolls that I've shot, each one is guaranteed to have at least 3 or 4 frames that didn't come out for some weird reason. The film is exposed and you'll partially see the image you shot but it will be distorted and folded. I'll only use Kodak from now on. The frames that weren't screwed up looked fine.
