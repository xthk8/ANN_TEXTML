Not sure that this is a fair test of the product. I have 16 4-foot LED shop lights, and this product did not reduce the EMI and noise on my FM radio. (The LED's do not seem to affect my garage door opener.)I noticed after purchasing the LED lights that they are not to be installed near radios...Since they didn't work in my environment, I returned them.
