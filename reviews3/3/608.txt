First off, Kudos to the manufacturer. They reached out and tried to solve my issues but I had already returned the item (CalinKit 3.0) and purchased the replacement (CarlinKit 4.0).About the CarlinKit 3.0 (this version): when it works, it's wonderful. However for my set-up (iPhone 14 Pro on the latest OS (iOS 16.2) with a 2018 Honda Pilot with factory-wired AirPlay, there were just too many connection disruptions to be useable. The connection would frequently fail, resulting in a frozen CarPlay screen. Or it would fail and reinitiate the connection sequence (sometimes succeeding, sometimes not). Or it would fail and reconnect successfully and resume working for a while. In any case, the choppy audio, frozen navigation, and disappearing CarPlay screens were far too frequent rendering 3.0 unusable to me. I upgraded to CarlinKit 4.0 and though it has only been a couple of days, I haven't had any failures yet. So fingers crossed, I'm very hopeful that the later version is the answer for me.Connectivity aside, it is fantastic to get in your car and have CarPlay work without taking your phone out and plugging a lightning cable into it. I've added a Belkin Magsafe Wireless charging phone mount to my vehicle also, so if I need to charge I can just drop the phone onto MagSafe, connect zero wires, and have both CarPlay and wireless charging. Or if I don't need a charge, the phone stays in my pocket and everything just works. It's really a nice upgrade to wired CarPlay. Latency? Yes, there is a bit of a delay but it is certainly not worth complaining about.
