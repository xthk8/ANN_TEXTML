I am an avid Instax user. I've been collecting and using them since I was 14, but this is actually one of the worst ones I've had so far in terms of photo quality. It's easy to use and does its job, but the photos come out incredibly dark. I thought maybe I clicked on the wrong setting, but the was the normal inside setting. I appreciate the nostalgia of polaroid photos, but this dark us a little unusual, especially at this price point.
