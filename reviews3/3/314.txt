1) I tested and put new batteries in THREE times. Each time the display indicates that the camera is not at full power (with one pair, the camera would only turn on for less than a minute before powering off).2) Menu settings and navigation takes practice because the buttons are not labeled well.3) You can't pull the SD card and plug into your computer to upload. They REQUIRE you to download their software and connect via USB cable. Even then the software is glitchy and not easy to navigate.4) I am 6'2" and the camera is TINY in my hands.With all of that being said (not having used it in a practical situation yet), I plan to keep it because I will be using it in situations where I do not want to take my phone: rain, deep woods, marshes & swamps. My hope is that in the long run, I will get decent photos with friends without the constant paranoia of losing/breaking my phone.
