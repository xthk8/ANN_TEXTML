These are super easy to use and plug in and get bluetooth sound quality. As a video editor that is NOT an audio engineer, I find these to have very mediocre sound quality by itself. I have to mess around with audio editing in adobe premiere for each of my videos, and they turn out sounding fine for being 30 yards from the camera and outdoors for sport videos.
