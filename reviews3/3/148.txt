I'm a photographer and a camera lover, and instant print is my favorite kind of photography so I had to check this out, I mean the reviews made it seem amazing. I got it for myself for Christmas and I keep going back to my instax minis, which cost about the same, take better photos, have a much much much better battery life, and are actually INSTANT. Sure it's fun to have pictures that are stickers (it's not easy to get the photo off the adhesive paper, FYI), and the printomatic can take some really artsy photos once you have spent tons of money on film and thrown away tons of trash photos learning how get the thing to utilize lighting properly etc, but then once I got that figured out it started taking all my photos off-center! I no longer know where to aim the camera so now I have to relearn that. The button is too easy to accidentally press and I have hit it so many times and taken idk how many pics of the inside of the camera bag, if is ridiculous. I could never in good conscience recommend this camera to anyone
