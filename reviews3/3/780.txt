Genuine ink manufacturer refills are obviously the best quality, and the manufacturer always hopes you will purchase from them. Here's the economical problem with this hope.- Too expensive, which attracts 2nd-hand refill providers.- Customers don't see much value in genuine ink vs the competition.- Customers purchase 2md-hand refills, which are often lesser quality, and could damage the printer.Either the manufacturer doesn't care they're losing money on ink, or they are hoping you'll damage your printer so you'll buy another. The error there would be that buyers would likely try another brand of printer in the hopes the printer will be more reliable, ink will be less expensive, and/or will tolerate 2nd-hand ink refills better.Solution: Just make the ink less expensive. If the genuine refills were merely 25-30% more than 2nd-hand, customers will often prefer genuine. However, at the current prices for genuine, it's just to expensive, plain and simple. So, yes, I tried 2nd-hand, and will again and again.
