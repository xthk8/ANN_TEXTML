Despite the looks, this is NOT your standard two post and insert type radio to fit your classic car. It is a standard DIN size. The knobs do come off, but there is no way to mount it as the face plate will not come off without major surgery. Also, the spacing of the knobs is different as can be seen in the photo. It appears that this same radio is available from many vendors all for +/-$30. If you want a REAL replacement that will fit your dash without surgery, it will cost you $200+. So I am left with a dilemma: Do I cut my dash to mount this (which actually looks quite nice with the rest of the dash) or do I send it back and cough up the extra for a radio that will fit without surgery? I suspect the electronics on any of them is about the same.I'll post an update when I decide.Update: I decided on surgery. I am sure it decreased the value of the car by more than the $300 I saved, but I have no intention of ever selling it and so, if it pleases me, it's OK. I like the look.
