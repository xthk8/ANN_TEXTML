I had 2 of these and ultimately I returned them both. As much as I liked the picture view of the PoE version of this camera I could never get all the functions to work properly. I went on for days with their tech support folks in Hong Kong but since they don't communicate very well in English I finally gave up and just returned it. So I tried this Wi-Fi version of the same camera and even though it was brand new and sealed in the box, it never powered on unless I held it upside down. So I returned it too. I decided to just try another camera instead of laboring any longer with this model.The tech support website is very good but woe unto you if that doesn't solve your problem. I have other Reolink cameras that are performing well but I guess it wasn't meant for me to have one of these.
