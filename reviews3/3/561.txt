We purchased two of these for our rentals. They are very helpful as a backup to the August app as many of our guests don't take the time to set up the app on their smart phones. The keypad works well inside of the August software to provide guests with unique entrance codes and schedule them at the time of their rentals. However, this keypad really needs a wired power supply. We need to change the batteries constantly on one and find it unreliable. As the keypad is outdoors, in winter the batteries are subject to extreme cold where we live. In summer, if it's in a sunny spot, it also has issues with the batteries becoming too warm. Unfortunately, no other keypad is available for the August Smart Locks so we are stuck with these. Pushing the buttons is also very clunky and prone to errors. The solution might be to try feeding a wire into the back of the keypad. It would need a 3 volt dc power supply.
