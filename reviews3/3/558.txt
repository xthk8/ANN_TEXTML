For the price this is a good product for lightweight cameras/ phones. The worst issue is that you cant clamp a smart phone securely to it if it has a phone case case attached. This is really a poor design for a phone holder clamp as all it would take is enlarging the clamp depth by a half inch to accommodate a phones case. Its annoying to have to remove your high dollar phones case just to use it in this unit. Thats almost a deal breaker honestly.
