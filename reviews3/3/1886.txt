This is just a sturdy piece of rubber-like plastic that lays on the floor through its own weight (no adhesion). It has a channel to hide an electric cord and will most likely keep you from tripping over the cord. A robot vacuum will glide over it as well. At the end of the day, it's a lot of money for a bit of soft plastic.
