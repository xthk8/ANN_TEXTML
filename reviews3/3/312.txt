These are labeled "20x50, 7.8°, 56m/1000m". The binoculars are 10x50. 7.8° or 56m/1000m field of view is correct for 10x magnification.Also, when these binoculars arrived they were decollimated, i.e., I saw two of everything. One of the objective lenses wasn't screwed in straight. I unscrewed the lens and carefully screwed it back in. Looks good now. The threads are plastic so I expect these binoculars won't stand up to rough use.For what I wanted these are good binoculars. When I travel to Latin America for birdwatching I give my binoculars to my guide, to lighten my luggage going home. Plus I don't want to worry about expensive binoculars getting stolen.
