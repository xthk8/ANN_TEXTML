The most powerful objective 40x was completely filled with dust and essentially unusable I managed to take it apart and clean it with isopropyl alcohol and put it. The 25x was also extremely dirty and as somebody who has never tried to repair lenses before I can say it is not exactly a fun experience.I am handy enough that I got it functional enough to a point where it is usable but you can tell that the focus is still slightly off.It seems to be a reoccurring issue that people who get this end up burning out the LED light by plugging it into the walls so if you do buy it I recommend you only run it on batteries to extend the life of the LED light or it might burn out pretty quickly according to other people.It works, it does what it's supposed to although you might have to put a little bit of elbow grease into it.I would buy one for my son to develop skills with but a friend with an actual goal or task that needs to be achieved, I would not recommend this.
