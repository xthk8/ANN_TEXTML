Install was pretty straightforward. Connected it to the head unit. The picture looks decent. The angle is a little off since it’s to the driver side and not directly center. So you have to compensate for that, lately when I put the vehicle in reverse there’s no picture until I unplug it and plug it back in again from underneath the vehicle and that’s not fixing the no picture now .
