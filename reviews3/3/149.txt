Picture:The Wyze V3 has a great picture quality especially at only 1080p. The picture quality rivals even higher resolution cameras. The camera also performs really well in night vision. Color night vision leaves a little to be desired but overall at this price point the quality is hard to beat.Software:The Wyze App is feature rich but unfortunately everything is behind a paywall. For those who are looking for cloud subscription and storage this is a great competitive product. The Cam Plus subscription allows for Full-Length Videos, back to back recordings and AI Detection, the Cam Plus Lite(Free) is much more limited offering 12 sec recordings with a 5min cooldown between events.For anyone not interested in online storage the camera does offer an SD Card for local recording but this is severely hampered in favor of the cloud storage. You will still only be notified of motion detection every 5min and in my testing recording to the SD card without a Cam Plus subscription did not work.3rd Party Compatibility:The Wyze V3 does not offer RTSP or ONVIF and recording to an NVR is a no go. While technically the V3 did at one point offer RTSP via a beta firmware upgrade(and you can still find it), Wyze has decided to remove the firmware and not support any further development on it.Final Thoughts:Overall if you're looking for a subscription based camera this is a fantastic choice especially considering the low hardware cost, quality hardware and feature full smart app.For anyone looking to use this camera with a 3rd party software I would strongly recommend you look elsewhere.
