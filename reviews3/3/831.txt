So far I like the looks of it and the beeps that it makes but I don't know what I am detecting - a little red plastic square came with it and I don't know how to incorporate that into the search - no instructions. I'm googling it and it's not easy to figure out. The device beeps near the bathtub but I don't see anything hidden - the tub is cast iron and built-in -it would be nice to have a clear idea of why it's beeping with all lights lit near the bathtub.
