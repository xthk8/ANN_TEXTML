If you need a cheap clamp mount, they are all about the same, so why spend $30 when $10 (on sale) will do? Wanting to expand my mounting options, and thought this would be a nice addition. For ten bucks, it is. The phone holder is useless for me--the lips that grab the side of the phone are so shallow that I couldn't fit my phone in face up! It's in a thin case, but it's a quad lock case, so it does have a teeny protrusion right in the middle, but even that tiny bump is enough to make it not fit. Got any kind of protective case, it would not work either.Of course that doesn't really matter because if you want to point your main camera at a target, you would need to put the phone into the mount screen down. And it's pretty hard to see what's on the camera when your phone display is mostly blocked by the mount! Tbh, I see many phone holders designed this way, so it's not just this product, but it's still annoying.
