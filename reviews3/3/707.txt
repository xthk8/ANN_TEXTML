The first and most obvious thing to know is that these are cheap, crazy cheap. Every part of these things feels like you can break them with you bare hands. The metal and the plastic are some of the cheapest junk I saw.With that being said, the lights do work and while I feel like they are a bit under powered, the combination of both of them end up working well. If you are the sort of person who is careful with their belongings, I can see these lasting awhile. Although eventually they are bound to burn out or break down in some capacity. These things were NOT designed to last.The "Value for money" rating was set the way it was for the above, but also due to the fact that these lights DO NOT INCLUDE PLUGS. They power cords taper off to the end of a USB, that means you'll need to figure out on your own how you plan on powering these lights.That's just the worst, I hate the fact I have went from drowning in USB power blocks to now having none because no one includes them anymore. And these are lights! I shouldn't be expected to include my own!
