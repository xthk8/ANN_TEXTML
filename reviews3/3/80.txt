This camera takes nice pictures, and is everything the various reviewers on the internet say (good pictures, videos, etc).For me, it was not what I wanted. The buttons and knobs are way too small, and my fingers are way too big to manipulate the thing. It is a very small camera, and is so light that it feels like a toy. On a tripod, it won't shake, but in my hands it has no heft at all and shakes too much.The menu system is tedious, especially with the tiny buttons. But the good part is that there is a huge amount of help available on the net, due to the popularity of the camera.I bought an aftermarket grip and it is a lifesaver. Made by Aodelan. It helps with adding a little mass to the whole thing, and if you get this camera get the grip, without a doubt.You need to be careful using this thing. The lens extends about an inch and a half when engaged, and if you accidently have the camera facing down, the motor will try and push the lens out and make the camera do a pushup. I am sure this will damage the lens motor, so watch out!The picture quality is a little better than my cell phone. It can take pictures in moderate lighting, but it gets grainy.I mostly use cameras for tracking myself dancing tango with a partner, and for food photography. I have a Samsung NX10, which became obsolete. And I have a Canon G7. I am not sure that this Sony camera is any better than my old G7. But it is more modern.I think I would have been better off spending the money on lighting and continue using the G7. But the Sony camera is a good product, if you can deal with the tiny controls.Realistically, a good cell phone is about the same as this camera. I think the next step up from a good cell phone is probably a full frame camera with a good lens.
