I’ve had the charger for about a week now and it’s overall quality is excellent. However for whatever reason, the clamps keep opening and closing automatically, and this happens when I’m driving. A few times my phone would fall out as I’m driving and my first thought isn’t to exactly pick up the phone while driving. The clamp is really good and holds well, but can’t figure out why it keeps opening automatically. My hands aren’t near it at all and my only conclusion is that it may be defective ?? Charger also does not work with my iPhone 12 Pro Max clear case. It only works without a case and I don’t typically like to have it without one (especially when it keeps opening randomly). So that’s a bummer. Charger also charged fairly slow. Only went up about 6% percent in my 30 min drive today. Would rate this charger 3/5 because I do believe it works for some and not others. I’m probably going to look to return since I can’t figure out how to stop it from opening randomly.
