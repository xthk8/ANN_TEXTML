HP's pricing is excessive, as is well known, but the quality is consistently excellent. For this price, these should be the higher-capacity XL cartridges, but if available at all, these have become very hard to find. Hence the nosebleed pricing.The old OfficeJet 8600 printers that use these cartridges continue to perform well. New printers are cheap but are, again, a crapshoot and ink for them is not that much cheaper.
