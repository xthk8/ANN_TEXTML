As much as I wanted these lights to work, they didn't quite do the job for me. It might work for some, but not for others. The problem that I had with these lights are that the plastic seems to brittle and the balance was not good at all. These lights don't have a counter balance so they're made with the intention for the lights to be left in an upward position. Once you move the light to face straight downward at a 90 degree angle it will tip over. Perhaps it was something that I overlooked and possibly a mistake on my part, but I would think that if you allow a light to be placed in degree angle then the stand should be able to support it. That was not the case with these lights. In all fairness the lights by themselves are good for the majority of video and photography situations that I would have needed it for. However, without being able to place the lights in certain angles rendered these lights basically useless with the entire light and stand tipping over. They come at a great price, but will only work for applications where you need the light coming from a near parallel angle to the ground.
