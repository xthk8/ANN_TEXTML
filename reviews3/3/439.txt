I'm trying to see if I can return this because I'm just not happy with the image quality. With a long zoom you need high ISO's to get a sharp image. This camera has a small sensor and really at even 400 ISO the image quality really starts to suffer. If you shoot at 200 ISO or less and are REALLY steady when zoomed in you can get good results. Otherwise I recommend on upgrading to something with at least a 1" sensor - or micro 4/3 if you can.
