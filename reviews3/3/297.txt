I’m using w Celeston binoculars. Easy to attach, but very challenging to line up camera lens. Binoculars become cumbersome when attached. I had hoped to use binoculars like I normally do and attach for photo if I see an interesting bird — not easily done especially if on a hike. I have to commit to using w or without before my hike. It eliminates bird app access when attached. I’m only able to answer my phone via Apple watch. Disappointed, but not a horrible purchase. Use on my backyard porch. Arrived early, package well, and price was reasonable.
