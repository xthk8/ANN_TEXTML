I think the concept is good, but I use an “Otter” case on my phone. I have to push the plug (on your product) in hard to get it to connect. THEN when I try to pull it our the magnet disconnects and I have to use forceps to remove it. Not practical for my phone. Might work with other items or phones that need charging, but for “my” phone it’s a DUD. Don’t waste your $$.
