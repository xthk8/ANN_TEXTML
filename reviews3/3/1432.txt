I dd NOT get 10% off of the automatic toner reorder -- even though it is advertised. It's convenient to have the printer automatically reorder toner, which I appreciate. The toner I received was supposed to authentic Brother toner through the Brother/Amazon partnership. The toner leaked onto the printer which caused several clean ups. Check out the price for the toner cartridge -- you do NOT get 10% off for the automatic toner reorder.
