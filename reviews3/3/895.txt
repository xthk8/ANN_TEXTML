The DJI RS 3 Combo is a great gimbal stabilizer for DSLR and mirrorless cameras. It has a payload of 3 kg (6.6 lbs), automated axis locks, 1.8" OLED touchscreen, and 3rd-gen RS stabilization algorithm. The gimbal is very easy to use and setup. It works great with my DSLR and mirrorless cameras. The gimbal is also very lightweight and easy to carry around.
