I currently have the DJI Osmo Action 1 and the DJI Mini 2 drone that I use for a fishing channel on YouTube. I let you know this so that you are aware that I am a supporter of DJI. If you check online, you will see that there is a soft or mushy video issue with the Osmo Action 3's manufactured in Sept and Oct of 2022. I purchased the Osmo Action 3 with the combo kit from Amazon on Dec 3rd hoping that I would get a good camera. Unfortunately, it had the mushy video issue so I contacted DJI and they had me send it back and then they sent me a replacement camera that was Manufactured in Oct and it had the mushy issue as well. So now I'm sending it back to Amazon and getting a refund. I still want this camera however I'm going to wait a few months until I can get a camera with a later manufacturing date. I'm not happy with DJI sending me a product that they know that they have an issue with. However, I'm happy that Anazon was quick to help me with my return request and a full refund. Shame on you DJI!!
