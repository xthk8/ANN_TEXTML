The Celestron Travel telescope is extremely uncomfortable to use as shipped. It's advertised for Astronomy and for beginners; and as a beginner, I like the scope. The official Celestron video says it can be used "to view the rings of Saturn, craters on the Moon..." – But only if you want to spend $52 dollars more for the right eyepiece! The 45-degree eyepiece diagonal that came with the scope is intended for terrestrial viewing and does not work well for Astronomy. Both Amazon and the manual show a picture of the 90-degree diagonal used for astronomy, but that’s not what is included. I had to squat in a position very uncomfortable for both my back and my knees -- even to look at something low in the sky. Forget about viewing something higher in the sky, unless I literally sit on the ground and even then, I still must bend. It is not fair to make me pay an extra $52 dollars for a scope that only cost $90. So. I reluctantly returned it.
