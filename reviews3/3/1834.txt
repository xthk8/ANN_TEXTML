Definitely does not come kinked or have problems some of the other products have received negative reviews for. However, be aware that it does not come with adhesive. On carpet it does move around a little bit. But since it lies flat from the start I expect it will work pretty well. If it were in a high traffic area I think you would need to buy some kind of double sided adhesive to make sure someone did not trip over it though.
