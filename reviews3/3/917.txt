Yes. I used a huge a$$ wrench to put this on. Was able to do it without even scuffing the rubber case though. Had the same mounting issue that everybody seems to be having. I did some research on the issue and all the sourced insisted: Force It. Went against every instinct but I did. I had to work it back and forth a bit. Took it off a couple times and hit it with my air compressor just in case there were any metal shavings. After some play it will go in easily by hand. Some people also recommended a very small amount of lubricant. I was super reluctant to force this thing on my Brand NEW HER9 so I totally get it if the thought of forcing it that hard makes you cringe. You feel that metal grind and it scrapes your soul. But I do feel like it is undamaged and affixed as intended. I soothed my anxiety by remembering that the new GoPros are built crazy tuff, and the waterproof seal is inside the ring that I was just concerned about scraping (score), and of course... The fact that I have a GoPro subscription “neener neener”. Apparently I get 2 “no questions asked” camera replacements per year. I was already planning on recording the inside of a fire in about 350 days “really wanna test that policy”. But I MUST be good if it were to get damaged by attaching their own product. But yeah, I had that to fall back on... Happy Filming!
