If you trigger the Blink manually because you think someone is messing with your car or on your porch, this will NOT record the feed. That is still behind a pay wall (my other cameras are grandfathered in before the pay wall so this is double annoying). It also DRAMATICALLY changed what my camera actually records / is triggered by. I park in the same spot and now this camera doesn't trip, ever. I had to increase the sensitivity by 3 levels to get it back to recording the same types of movements in the same places. The ONLY thing I changed was adding this - I didn't move the camera at all. While I'm happy to have SOME recordings, knowing it won't do anything if I trigger it manually and the changes to when it records automatically are frustrating. My final star deduction came because you have to delete clips individually. The others you can do in batches or all at once. This one, you have to wait for each individual clip to load and delete one at a time if using the app. Big waste of time every day. While I'm still not happy about paying for BLINK features that were previously free, this is about a half measure to address it. For the price, it's steep but still better than a monthly recurring fee.
