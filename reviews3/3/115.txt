Not the cheapest or the most expensive drone. It’s lightweight and isn’t chunky but it is blown away in high winds. No separate remote control: you must download the phone app. App & controls are straight forward. A couple of flying modes. Good handle. It flies where it’s commanded to. Connection does break at times, but it comes back eventually.Subpar camera quality. It’s fine during the day without sunlight glare, but it’s staticky and barely visible at night, even with artificial light turned on.I recommend getting the bundle. Regardless though, one battery is barely enough for one flight, even without pictures and videos during it. You can’t fly it too far or high. The batteries don’t take long to charge, maybe an hour, however, from my experience, even a new charged one only lasts about 10 minutes max, not including not-in-use drainage. Propeller guards are underestimated. They work well and come in handy especially if it’s your first time flying. I tried a drone with gps, but it was a disaster. This gave me no problems calibrating and updating. It flies smoothly. Landing is exceptional-it slows itself down on its way to your hand or the ground.Bottom line: get this if you’re a true beginner, have never flown a drone, or want a cheaper drone you don’t have to worry about losing or damaging. If you can afford to and you’ve flown a drone before, get a better one with a case included.
