One year ago I bought this very same 3 pack of 24 exposure rolls of UltraMax for $20.50 (was actually cheaper at Walgreens- $17.00). Now it's selling for $36.75?!This is the fault of Kodak. We need an alternative to Kodak’s dominance. Kodak film sales have been going up roughly 20% a year for the past five years. Yay, that’s a good thing for film enthusiasts. But faced with increasing demand Kodak has chosen to do something that I feel is abhorrent. Kodak has said it needs to increase production, okay, that’s a given, but they chose to fund that by dramatically increasing the cost of a roll of film instead of the traditional method of using a commercial lender to raise the capital necessary to do this. They feel they can do this on the backs of their customers because they are the only game in town. Where else are we going to go?I hope some company rises up to challenge Kodak. I would love to see Fujifilm fully get back in the game. I don’t like being at the mercy of one supplier for anything.
