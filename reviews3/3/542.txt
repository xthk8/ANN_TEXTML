After much frustration and watching hours of videos I finally got my unit set up and it appears to be working. A couple of problems is the manual is about 3pt type that is impossible to read and does not walk you though anything practical. A nice start- setup guide would be good. I finally found a nice video on you tube that helped however the next issue was the app itself. I tried and tried to get the app to connect from the play store on android and could not get it to connect to the device. It could see it in Bluetooth but not connect. I finally found a phone number for support and discovered two problems. First, the only app on the Play store was old and not the right one (no mention of that anywhere online or in the manual) Next, the support guy, although difficult to understand was nice enough to point me in the right direction on the DJI site to download a executable to install the app however, I have a company phone and it will only install apps from a verified source and would not install the app. I was able to use an old iPhone to download and it seemed to work. I still have not figured out how the app works completely and I get strange popups that refence something technical that I don't understand what it is saying. Hopefully a few more hours of YouTube videos will get me comfortable.After balancing and connecting everything the unit does seem to work well with one additional problem I still can't figure out when using the Canon connect app to use as a monitor. My phone keeps going to sleep and I can only increase the time to 1 minute in the settings. This may just be due to being a company phone and not DJI's problem.I am excited to try this out on a video shoot this weekend and will update the review after some hands on use
