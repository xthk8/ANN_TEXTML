How does a camera, when using flash, still produce a blurry image? I wasn't shaking it around. I was standing in place. And it was daytime, near a window. I mean, it's cheap, but wow, it's just bad. Small enough, easy to use. Photos are VERY "meh." Haven't tested the water resistance, don't really care to.
