So this was a return for me. Did I give it it's due.... Maybe not. There's alot of good with this unit. It's small, lightweight, easily concealable and easy to EDC or every day carry depending on your line of work, ie: travel. My gripe is that it's not as user friendly as I hoped. I mean it's super to easy to use but that's the problem. It's super simple. It's basically got a few lights on it that show how far away your range is depending on how many times your click for added range. The review videos are horrible and most don't know what the lights are for. And that was another turn off. It was alot of folks that seemed to be in a reviewer group or something and none of them knew how to use it or were serious about the product. My gripe is that it just seemed to beep at everything. There's no meter or anything to give you any idea your doing it right except some beeping lights. I just didn't want to spend $60 for a product that I wasn't 100percent confident in. Now that being said that was just my experience and me. The reviews are really good. So I'd give it a go if your in need of the service. It may be right for you. You can always send it back. They were really great to deal with. I want to say they offered to help but I can't remember. Anyway, I don't regret buying it, just wasn't meant for me. Maybe they will add some sort of meter or gauge that at least let's you know your doing something right.
