I don’t have anything to knock about this Barlow except it could have been better with more than one set screw, and it’s expensive for what it is. It is a single lens Barlow, and honestly, for what it is, you can get the same quality in off brands for half the price, maybe less. So far I have not felt like the quality of Celestrons brand surpass their competitors enough to be worth the price increase for the “brand name.” Save your money, get a cheaper version, (I’ve had good luck with Sbvoney) and maybe another eyepiece to go with it for the same price you would have spent on this.
