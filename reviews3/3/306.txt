You get a retractable brush that looks and feels like it's designed to apply blush makeup, a felt-wrapped plastic stick and a plastic keycap puller. The plastic keycap puller will surely break before you get all the keycaps off your keyboard; but this is exactly what you must do to use this kit. The brush is too wide and too soft to get any debris from between the keys unless you pull all the keycaps. The other tools also don't fit between the keys. Exactly what is this supposed to clean? It makes a much better makeup kit than a keyboard cleaning kit.
