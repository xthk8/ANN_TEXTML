Decent set for the price, but the spray bottle does not come with a cleaning solution and the foam cleaner loses hair very easily. I filled the spray bottle with basic glass cleaner and went to clean out my AirPods pro and all the hair fell off the end of the tool. The screen cleaner on the back also doesn't work very well, the plastic on the case can rub against your screen and I was able to do a better job with an automotive microfiber cloth. But, the silicone tip and both the large and small brushes work well. Not the worst deal for the money, but I would not buy it again.
