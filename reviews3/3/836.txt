We have had so many issue's with this thing. We have only used it for about 2 months and we have already had to charge it 2 or 3 times. It goes offline all the time and when we try to get it back to all our phones it is an ordeal. I am so frustrated with this thing. Just when we think we have it figured out something else happens and we have to start all over.
