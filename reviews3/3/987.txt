This product is awesome, and very usable, once you can maneuver it in to position. The 2 downsides are, 1. the cable is very stiff, and takes some effort to get in place, but once in place, it will stay. 2. The phone clip, could have a little more length in the strap that allows how wide the clip can open. Would allow for a bigger phone. Otherwise a great product, once you get it setup. Setup could be easier.
