I like these replacements and I would buy them again. They fit and they are easy to install. Overall they work quite nicely and it is nice that they have some size options so you can see which one really works best for you.The downsides are more about personal preference. I feel like the rubber is a little thinner than the originals and that causes me a little trouble. The first bit of trouble is not a huge deal. When I pull these out of my ears, the rubber tends to fold out in a bell shape. Basically they turn inside out and I have to tuck them back into shape before putting them in the case. Not a huge deal, but not my favorite thing either.Then the bigger issue- Noise cancellation just doesn't seem as good as with the originals. The fit seems nice and snug, so I suspect this may be a rubber-thickness issue again. I think they are just not as good at blocking the sound in the first place, so it limits the effectiveness of the noise cancellation feature. Basically, more outside sound is getting in overall, so it overwhelms the cancellation. It isn't awful, so I will keep these and it will be fine. I just know it could be better.
