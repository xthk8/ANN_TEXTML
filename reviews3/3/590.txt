Pros:- Great microphones, listeners won't have a problem hearing you- Great Bluetooth reception, good range and no random disconnects- Great battery life, 20+ hours easilyCons:- Way too bass heavy and muddy sound for listening to music- Bluetooth lag is terrible, so it's not for watching movies or playing games- Terrible volume controls, they're rubber touch points instead of physical buttons so you can't feel them with your fingersIf you're looking for a headset that can do everything, get something else. This headset is great for voice calls and that's it. It's way too bass heavy and the audio quality is too muddy for listening to music, which is a shame because that's what headsets should be capable of at a minimum. The Bluetooth lag is also terrible for watching movies, there's about 1 second of lag. It also makes playing games unplayable, since you rely on instant sound response to react to the game.
