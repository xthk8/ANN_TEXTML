I purchased a new, not refurbished unit just after Christmas, Once everything was connected o had to fight the unit to level the picture, after all that the internal speaker did not work at. Fought connecting a Bluetooth speaker and after several tries hot it to work. Since I paid $597.00 for the unit I wanted everything to work so I sent it back and was about to order a new one when I saw the price jumped $200.00 to $797.00.
