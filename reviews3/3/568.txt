 I bought this because I wanted to do an i unboxing video but it doesn’t hold well with my phone case and I think it’s missing a piece. When I assemble it my husband saw that it was wobbly hence the tape that he had to add so it will be tighter in that location. I think it’s okay but you can probably find a better one. Keep searching. And no I couldn’t record my video. I have an iPhone 13 n it felt too tight and hard to be able to hold the phone or maybe because I’m currently a bit weak due to an injury.🤷‍♀️
