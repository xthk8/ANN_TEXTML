The good: Charger works well on my iPhone 14 Plus and it has the Otterbox Defender case on it. 👍The bad: It won’t hold and stay put and falls off. The air vents that it attaches to are too shallow and tight. (98 Dodge Ram 2500)Convenient placement, but it interferes with the operation of my stereo receiver.I wanted to like this product better but I can’t so I’m returning it and look for something that attaches to the windshield. My dash is all cracked and trashed so dash placement is right out.
