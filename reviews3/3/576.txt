I usually look at reviews, but I got in a hurry and bought right away. Now I'm replacing this and I've had it for about 3 hours.I think it will hold my phone fine, but it doesn't give me confidence it will be sturdy. It's all plastic, including the screw that lock the angle tilt into place. The lips that hold that phone are very shallow. It uses a ratchet system to lock the phone in (you squeeze the top/ bottom until it clicks tight onto the phone). This is probably acceptable, but because of the shallow lips, you definitely need to make sure it's as tight as possible.The screw that tightens the angle is really bad. It's very small and not in the best spot to adjust. I have to crank it down hard to lock the holder. Then, it's really hard to unlock it to move if you need to do fine adjustments. It also feels like you could snap the screw.The cold shoe locks in fine, but it's plastic too and yet another aspect that concerns me long term.Overall, it will work, but it's annoying, weak, and gives me no confidence that it won't end up smashed into pieces the first time it's bumped.
