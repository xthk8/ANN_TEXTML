Skillcandy had been one of the few brands that consistently comes out with headphones and earbuds I approve of.While I'm still not a fan of Bluetooth, finally forced into it. I was satisfied with the sound quality.Disappointed by the battery life at first. Really disappointed by the durability. I have 3 pairs of wired earbuds, each from 3-7 years ago and they all work fine. These still have nice bass which is surprising, but the upper register got a rattle after about 2 months. Left bud popped out at about 3-4 months, and now at 7-8 months, the both buds are barely holding on: left bud just frayed off and right bud is rattling anywhere above a tenor.I've never been this disappointed with skullcandy before.
