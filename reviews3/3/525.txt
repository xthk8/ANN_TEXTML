Camera seems fine, although has some lag with the auto focus. Initially thought I was sent an "open box" as the box was not sealed, manual was not in a plastic sleeve and the lens cap was also not wrapped. After reviewing some unboxing videos on YouTube, I think this is the way they're shipping them now. I would definitely prefer a seal on the box, better wrapping of the actual camera, and the manuals in plastic as they were rattling around in the box and made it sound like something was broken before I opened it. But it seems "ok" so far.
