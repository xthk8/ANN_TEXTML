Remote is great, tripod is well made, phones in vertically are no problem. Bigger phones (example: Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra in a case) start to get heavy horizontally.The phone fits the adapter just fine, it's the weight. This is especially true if you are attempting to film horizontally and down. With a big phone, this just topples right over.Maybe some added weight to the back leg or something. Would also be great if the legs spread out a little more, they have limited movement at the joints (where the legs connect to the main tripod body). Legs themselves can wrap around a thin pole, but the joint isn't as generous. If you wanted this tripod to do a full split for example, it cannot.
