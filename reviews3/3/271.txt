Watching movies the pixels blurred together, subtitles weren't too clear but legible. I already had an unused chrome cast so finding something to hook up to the hdmi was no issue. I will have to admit though, it sucks not being able to use the USB slot for anything other than viewing on an actual USB drive. You can not hook your phone up to the USB or any hand held gaming consoles which really sucked. Yes, a lot have hdmi adaptors and you can mirror your phone on HDMI, but for convenience sake, it would be nice if the usb worked fully. The quality is horrible for gaming though. Watching movies I couldn't really tell, but trying to interact with something made it harder.It also only works in the dark. You need it to be night time or you need some good blackout curtains. Even having a phone on in the room will affect the quality of the light projected. It works for what I needed it for, but I wish I saved up my money and bought something higher quality so I could use it for more than one thing
