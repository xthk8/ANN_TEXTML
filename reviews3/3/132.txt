I have purchased many of these over the last few years, my previous PLT headset worked amazing 2021 Voyager. The one I recently purchased, the2022 Voyager 5200 is terrible as the noise cancellation is terrible and distorts everything the moment there is loud noise or I speak even slightly loud. I have had this experience with previous voyager Bluetooth devices. It seems that if you get a good one it works great but many have either bad noise cancellation or problems holding connections. I have had both. I absolutely love the product when it works and keep coming back, this time for more punishment....... Trying to get Plantronics to replace under warranty with little luck to date...... maybe wont be coming back again. If you have any problems upon receiving, immediately return until you get a good one.
