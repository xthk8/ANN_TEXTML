I will not go into details already covered in other reviews. But I will mention that the auto focus of this camera is a huge failure and now I understand why the price of this camera is so low. I have two professional cameras that will require more skills to get great photographs, the reason I purchased this was to have actually a point and shot, but it failed. Canâ€™t even take a quick photograph using the zoom to capture a nearby volcano eruptions. It is a complete waste as the auto focus fails to work. The auto focus of the Nikon P900 is way better and faster than this fiasco of a camera.
