I just received this band yesterday. The band seems very durable. It is comfortable. I have a big wrist so it still fits fine with extra room if I needed to make it bigger. My problem with the item is not with the band but the screen protector that comes with it. As you can see in the picture that the screen guide it is not lined up with the actual screen protector. So when I try to put the guide over my watch to install the screen protector, it was not a line. It actually was hitting the frame of the watch. I did not notice that when I installed the first one when I got the second one installed. I tested it lined it over the watch and realize that the guide was not centered with the actual screen protector. It’s off-center a little, so I was not able to use the screen protectors that comes with it. That’s the only problem I had with it.
