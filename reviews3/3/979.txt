I purchased this product to scan family phot albums into a digital format. The product mounts easily and the locking mechanisms work pretty good. My only complaint is the clamp that holds the phone. I have an IPhone 13 Max Pro and the clamp can’t be centered on the phone unless you turn off the emergency notification setting. I clamped it twice, my phone called 911 and I thought I turned it off in time; I was wrong. The other issue was the width the clamp would expand without. It barely made the width of the i[hone and there was so much tension it popped out the springs in the clamp. I was able to use it for a few days before the springs popped out. I think the product is good if you don’t stress the clamp.
