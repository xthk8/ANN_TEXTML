My quest for a pocketable, versatile and reliable light to use for phone photography, casual vlogging and the occasional Zoom call may have finally concluded! Check out my photos 📸📸📸Pros 👍👍👍- Size: It disappears in the palm of your hand!- Brightness: This thing shines bright like a diamond (Thanks Rihanna 😂)- Charging: USB-C port 👍- Waterproof: up to 33ft (10m)- Ease of Use: Single button to do it all. The button itself is rubberized and perfectly sized. Long press for ON/OFF and quick press, 1-4, to cycle between brightness levels and strobe mode 🔦🦺😊Cons 👎👎👎- Diffuser: Better than most but still comes off a little too easily 😒- Charging Port Cover: you need to remove the diffuser to open it 🤦‍♂️- No Standard 1/4” thread so you’ll need an adaptor to use it with your existing tripods. Really? 😑- Inexplicably wasteful packaging: Huge box for a tiny light! 😑My Verdict 🧐It is a little overpriced but considering the build quality and the way it has worked for me so far, I can certainly recommend this product. If you’re looking for the brightest light in the smallest package possible, this is it!Dear GoPro ✍️🧐If you’re reading this, please consider these suggestions for future iterations of this product to make it even more versatile:1️⃣ Incorporate a standard 1/4” thread to the bottom of the mount.2️⃣ Add a magnet to the back of this light💡🧲
