So many high expectations for "The Greatest Showman," after reading the glowing reviews and seeing the cast, though alas, only a couple of tunes stay with you and maybe a few verses of others. Overall fine but not spectacular entertainment, with most glaring weaknesses being Michelle Williams (Charity) and Zendaya (Anne) miscast IMHO. Perhaps, Rebecca Ferguson (Jenny) and Williams should have traded roles and Zendaya completely recast altogether, as there was little chemistry between Hugh Jackman (Phineas) and Charity's characters' romances, same for Zac Efron (Phillip) and Anne. Overuse of CGI and non-on-location sets also didn't help (making you wonder how much of the film was computerized). The kids may go for it, and its universal message of acceptance shines through, but you may have some explaining to do with the movie's quite eccentric characters.
