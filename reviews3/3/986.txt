I bought this as a gift, and when I actually saw it, I was unimpressed because it is way too bulky. It’s this huge thing you clamp on your desk or wherever you want to set it. It is very sturdy, which is great, and holds the phone good enough. But there are other phone holders out there that are not as bulky and annoying to attach to desks or tables. That’s my only qualm, but the recipient liked their gift and denied my request to maybe return it for another holder. If I bought for myself, I would have returned right away. I don’t like how huge and bulky it is, and I don’t like how it attaches to things.
