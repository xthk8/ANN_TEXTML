I purchased this Camera for my partner's birthday, as an on-the-spot idea moment. I did my research, and I felt fairly confident that what this device had to offer, was exactly what I felt comfortable loaded into my partner's car.I purchased the additional kit to have it hard-wired to the car battery, to record when she was away from th vehicle. Immediately, her brand new battery kept draining (yes, wiring was verified to be correct). A couple months later, through the summer, this device began *Melting*. Not a big deal, so as long as everything still works.It wasn't long after that, that the device just kept Freezing and not starting up with the car. It would crash and reboot, only to be stuck on the logo. Mind you, this is *after* I had unplugged the front facing camera, which caused it to 100% freeze during bootup if left in..Bottom line, this camera was a neat idea on paper. Modular and slim.. but in reality, it's current design simply can not keep up with today's demands. I would love to get a replacement, if that were offered.TL;DR PROS- Really good picture quality and slim design- Installed easily; Worked... at first.- Comes with a questionably cheap 64GB "free" SD card- Modular design is very neat- Good supportTL;DR CONS:- Stopped working after a couple months, which is basically the worst con ever.- Difficult to use app for the wifi feature- - - - - - - -EDIT: 1/31/2023 - I was not asked to edit this review, but after posting it, AZDOME reached out and gave me a full refund. My device may have just been faulty. I am happy to see the support that backs this project. Thank you! This device is still worth a try.
