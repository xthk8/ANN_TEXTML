Based on what I read in the Cart, this purchase came with a high yield toner as well. In the listing, there is a phrase that looks like it was tacked on... "not a toner" which I should have looked into further since it was not clear to me. But then it says right afterwards, "12000 yield, black" which is what I wanted to read... I get the drum and some toner for the price indicated. It even told me black toner...just what I wanted. Good deal. I decided to keep my old printer and fix it. So I was disappointed to open the box and only find replacement drum that as clearly reconditioned. Not a good deal. Please change the phrasing in your listing... Brother Genuine Drum DR630 not a Toner, Page Yields approximately 12,000 pages , Black... to "Brother Genuine Drum DR630. Drum Page Yields approximately 12,000 pages when printing in Black. No toner included in this purchase."
