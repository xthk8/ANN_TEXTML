So if I think about it, I will give this products a rating most likely if I think about it in about six months because this is a product in which you need to find out if it lasts and it works. My last phone charger lasted and it’s still working, but it started to go so it lasted about two years. That’s after two failed attempts at phone chargers from the cell phone store. So I purchased one from Amazon. But I saw this multi pack and I’d like to have a phone charger for my car that is short in length so that’s the one that I’m using and that’s the one that I’ll be using the most to find out how well and how long this charger lasts. So far I have to say that obviously when you purchase something like this, when you click it into the USB port and your cell phone, it has that kind of new feeling feel . So far everything is good. It’s only been a few days. So there you have it. If I remember in several months to make a review and say hey, it’s lasting it’s good I’ll try to do that. Because I am a customer consumer who tries to find products that have decent reviews . It’s helpful.
