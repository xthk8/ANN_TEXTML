*update: I ended up returning and reordering new camera that didn’t show up in time for my planned trip unfortunately. A couple weeks later, insta360 customer service reached out to offer help due to my negative review. They offered to replace my camera and pay return shipping. They sent me a bicycle handlebar mount as a way to rectify the issue. So far the new camera is working just fine. Updating to 3 stars since they did reach out to try to help, even though I’d already solved my own issuePrevious:Camera required a firmware update right out of the box Yet would not accept the update. Tried updating via the app and via micro SD card. Reset camera to factory, deleted and redownloaded the app, restarted my phone, restarted the camera several times.. nothing worked. Customer service was terrible. Couldn’t get anyone on the phone and they make you pay to return the camera. New camera isn’t sent until they get your old one so you’re new camera you’re excited to get is going to take another 3 weeks to get. In retrospect I should have bought a GoPro manufactured in the US. Will be requesting a refund.
