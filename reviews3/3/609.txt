I have a 2022 Kia Telluride and was really not trying to use a wired cord for my phone every time I got in the car. In the beginning, this product would work every 9 out of 10 times without needed to pull the wire out and re-plug it back in. The average time it would take to get my phone connected through the system was usually 1 minute of waiting, and at worst it would be 5 minutes when it did connect.When we first got the car, we were driving from about 7 hours because we picked it up out of state and that was the first time we could test out the longevity: it did kick my phone off a few times during the drive and we were trying to troubleshoot by again unplugging and replugging it back in. I would say for a long ride you are better off just using a wired cord rather than this product.After almost 1 year of having it (during which I only drove my car about 1-2x/week for a total of 3-4 hours all together), the red light is persistent and it will not connect my phone to the car. It keeps popping up with an error message along the lines that the system cannot recognize the cable and to use a proper cable. I'm pretty upset as we only started to really use it end of December when we got the car, but I ordered it in advance and while I'm within the one year mark, I'm not sure if there is really a warranty or other coverage for it as there doesn't seem to be useful information from the Amazon order screen when I checked.If you can get this product for under $75, I would say its worth the gamble if you have a car that has built in car play and you use an iPhone. On that same note, I would say to also keep a regular wire in your car just in case.
