I’ve been using Popsockets for many years and have to use them on my phone. It makes your phone so much easier to hold and not feel like you’re going to drop it. They work great as a stand when watching videos. This is the first newer, redesigned version I’ve bought though and I don’t like the “updates” they have made. They feel cheaper made and spin too easily. I do somewhat like how they changed the way you can remove it from the base and put on a different popsocket but you can’t switch it out for an older version. The materials they use just feel cheaper than older ones but it does its job I guess and I do recommend them. Get an older model if you can though. The translucent model is very cool looking!
