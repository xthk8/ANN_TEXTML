I was torn between the Shure SM57 and the Audio Technica AT2020. I opted for the SM57. I use it for home recording with Logic Pro. It was ok, but for acoustic guitar and vocals it was a bit muted. I ordered the AT2020 and it was much better. So if you are looking for a good studio mike for acoustic guitar, I would not recommend this one. But if you are recording drums and electric guitar, then I think this one would get the nod.
