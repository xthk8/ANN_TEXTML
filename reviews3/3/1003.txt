I've heard mixed reviews about pop sockets in general. So far I'm 50/50 over my 1st socket. This one specifically I wish was clear like in the photo but it comes in like a yellowish tone (the type if turns into once you've had for a while and it's dirty) not loving that aspect.*wish all pop sockets had a top that opens not just the ones for lip balm.And lastly I wish the socket was more sturdy when in a mount. It moves around too much I will need to add a magnet to it (which I don't want bec it is a clear socket)If only they made it in a way that when the socket is collapsed it is secured down for more sturdiness.Ps the adhesive is pretty bomb. I did misplace it twice so as long as you don't press down on it it should lift up well enough to readjust but it is quite good adhesive so might have to pull back out a bit to do so. I was able. And then once I was happy w placement I added pressure. I was able to use mount right away also. I wasn't concerned it would fall off (and it didnt)
