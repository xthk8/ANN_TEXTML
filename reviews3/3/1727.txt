It barely fits one XLR and headphone cable. If you're running anything more, look at larger options. It's also a bit *too* floppy and doesn't protect the cables much. Will definitely cause problems with a cable over time if you keep stepping on it. I guess I shouldn't be surprised for the price, it works for now.
