This review is mostly about the seller. The camera itself seems to be a good point and shoot especially for a teenage girl... if it would stay on for more than a minute.The seller... I ordered this at the end of September for a Christmas gift. I was excited because I found this $60 camera for only $20 and thought I was getting a great deal. When I received it I turned it on and tested it out briefly. It seemed to work pretty well, however after my daughter received it for Christmas (three months later) and played with it for a few minutes it shut off randomly. At first it turned right back on then it stopped turning on and responding all together. We put different brand new batteries in it and once again it turned on but this time it shut off right away. We observed that it never showed a full battery icon even with new batteries. So obviously this camera does not work right and I immediately requested a refund. The seller, lotus media, refused because it had been more than 30 days since I purchased it. I wrote another email requesting that they take into consideration that it had been purchased as a Christmas gift and that was the reason for the delay, but they stuck by their “policy” and would not budge. I tried to file an A to Z claim with amazon and was told by them that I was outside my time frame for filing a claim. So basically I’m screwed. I’m glad that I only spent $20. Lesson learned - spend more time testing out electronics, a deal that’s “too good to be true” really is not a deal at all, and though I’ve always had good experiences with amazon I’m disappointed they didn’t back me on this. I can’t believe that this seller didn’t know exactly what they were selling and that’s why the price was so low. I’m sure they thought that was good enough compensation for the fact that the camera doesn’t work right, but this fact should have been made known in the description of the camera.
