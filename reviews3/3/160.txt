This lens is very basic. It will give you some bokeh but even with a high f stop much of what is in the background has a lot of noise and isn't very sharp. I go out and do street photography and some of the people are across the street and when I zoom in on them the image is depressing. But if you are taking pics of people or things that are within 20 feet you should get a decent picture. I can't afford a better lens but will rent one day to do a comparison.
