Received my Apple Air Tag key fob on time and well packaged, but downhill from there. Main problem with my AppleAirTag key fob is the ring holding keys opens up accidentally and way too easy. The fob itself is good looking and holds the air tag securely and the colors are pleasing. However, I’ve had mine open up while carrying it and having my keys drop off. This happens when I’m carrying something with my fob and keys in the same hand. A small bit of pressure will open the key ring up with generally bad results. Thankfully I haven’t lost any keys but the last incident promoted me to write this review. To keep it unintentionally opening up I put a dab of super glue on the opening mechanism.
