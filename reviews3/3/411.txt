Delivery came quickly. It was easy to swap the larger ear buds for the smaller ones. The sound quality is really good. Noise cancelling aspect is ok. The disappointing part is that within minutes of starting to use the earbuds, the wire connection closest to the phone became very sensitive. Any movement of the phone into or out of my pocket, the sound was lost in either one or both buds. When I am walking with the phone in my pocket, it seems to be fine. I have had cheaper buds last a lot longer before starting to give at that point on the wire.
