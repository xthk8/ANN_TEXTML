A set of Triax speakers for 30 bucks, what can go wrong???? These fit in the spaces for the rear speakers in a 1994 F150 Extra Cab. The front Boss rounds were also 30 bucks a pair and fit the stock positions in the doors. Sound is barely better than stock and the 20 year old Awia CD-skipper/AM-FM radio combo distorted the heck out of them at 60% of full power and its rating is 25 watts per channel. At 75% it got scary! No way these are 225 Watts per pair, not even RMS. Boss must use a proprietary formula to calculate the power rating of these babies and it is nowhere near the math I learned at Tech school, LOL! But they sure are pretty, too bad they are behind the speaker grills. BTW, it's been 8 weeks since install and they are still working. Surprise, surprise! I got what I paid for and in a 28 year old pickup with over 340,000 miles, that gets 11 MPG, they suffice.
