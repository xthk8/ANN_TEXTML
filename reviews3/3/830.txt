Simple to setup and use, video quality is pretty good, and price is excellent! Inside in temp controlled environment the battery life is pretty good but outside in the cold it will lose capacity, just the nature of lithium batteries.The buttâ€¦ I could never get it to connect to the internet and stream when I connected it to my outdoor access point. It would work perfectly when I configured it to connect to my indoor wireless router. Funny thing was I could go out beside the camera and connected to the same access point and it would work locally but if I switched to cellular it would not connect to the camera just like when on the inside router, would not connect. Tried to open the DMZ, port forwarding, etc, all I knew how to do and never did get it working while configured on the outside access point. Tech support was non-existent, sent several help requests via the app with no response. Finally gave up on it and moved it back in the house connected to my inside router and it works like it should. -1 star for the issue and -1 star for no tech support.
