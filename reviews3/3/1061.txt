This product is supposed to fit a TV from 22 inches up and that's complete BS! My son's TV is 22 in and we got this to replace the kongfu pandas TV stand as the plastic one it came with broke. It does fit the TV but the brackets stick out of the top like satellite antenna. ðŸ˜’ It looks absolutely ridiculous. If you move the TV up to hide the brackets it's too top heavy to stand. The instructions are garbage. Work in reverse for less of a headache. Find what fits the TV prior to putting it together. I had to take it completely apart before attaching to the TV bc of this. If your tv is on the larger end of the requirements you should do just fine with this stand.So overall avoid this massive migraine of a janga puzzle if you have a smaller TV!
