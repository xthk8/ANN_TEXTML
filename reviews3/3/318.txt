I can’t leave a proper review because one, it doesn’t come with a camera strap, it doesn’t come with a shoe mount, It’s very difficult to find an adapter that is reasonable and works with this camera without being forced to pay for the METABONE adapter. Everything about this camera so far is trying my nerves. I cannot believe how I can’t find a decent adapter. I have been searching and searching. I am just about ready to feature the entire thing. I’ve purchased separate monitor, batteries, battery pack holder, cage, dual slot, cFast card. All this along with the frustration is adding up. Even worse NO STABILIZATION. THIS MANUFACTURER NEEDS TO FIX THIS. THIS IS A BASIC SHELL AND IN HAVE TO PURCHASE MORE TO HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A GREAT CANERA. IN HAVE A PROJECT TO DO NEXT WEEK NOW I AM PUSHED FOR TIME. SO VERY UNHAPPY RIGHT NOW
