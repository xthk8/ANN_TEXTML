I've had three HL-L-K2325 printers. With the third one, I was forced to get a different model toner cartridge. The only difference between the first cartridges I used for the first two printers and this last one is that Brother is now putting a chip on their cartridge to be identified with their current printers. Without the chip, the new printers will not work. So for me, I now have four extra toner cartridges that are useless for this printer. In addition, when you run out of the starter cartridge, you cannot just slip these new cartridges into the printer and expect it to work. I had to get on YouTube and go through some weird coded button presses in order to eliminate the Deep Sleep and Reset the toner page counting mechanism to make this new printer work. A major hassle that is totally unnecessary and very time-consuming. I know Brother is doing this to counter the third-party toner companies, but I resent thatthey decided to have their purchasers suffer the consequences.
