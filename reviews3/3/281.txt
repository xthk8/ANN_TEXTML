So like everyone else here, I pre-ordered -- excited by the handful of press reviews, and thinking this would be an ideal way to sneak a decent sized screen (well ok, the ceiling) in my son's room so we can watch videos together. I'll caveat this that I have the Jafir cheapo 1080p projector in another room - this factors below:The good:Great form factorGood sound - no need to offload to something else. Though bluetooth headphones as an option is pretty cool.Reasonably bright in a dark roomThe bad:Auto Keystone and focus are not great. Frequently have to monkey with it if I move or reposition the unitMisleading brightness. The Jafir, which I paid about $120 for, is brighter. Not as portable or smart, but doesn't matter if you can't see the pictureLAG!!! OMG. on the Jafir I put a fire stick for the smart TV bits - nice and smooth. Here, I have to wait 1-2 minutes when first turned on to settle, then cross my fingers it responds. Really needs a stronger processor.The 1080 output isn't bad per se, once the focus is dialed in. But it's not 4k -- and for over $800 it feels like a rip off.Still debating sending it back. It's a cool toy in principle, but at a minimum it should be able to keep up with the remote and if they're advertising the autofocus and keystone correction -- they should be rock solid. And at the moment, they are not.
