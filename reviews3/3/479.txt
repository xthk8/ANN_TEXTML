The dual cameras is nearly impossible to stitch together at night when using IR. The balance is pretty bad and you end up with a very clear line right down the middle of the super ultra wide picture. One half is always much brighter than the other unless you have a perfectly even field of view. If you have any objects that are closer to the lens that the other side of the picture, the IR glares off the object and looks pretty bad. However in the daytime its pretty good with that 180deg field of view.
