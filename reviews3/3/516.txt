The case is nice. This would be a 5 star review if not for the 2x Barlow lens. We've only had our 70mm for a year & are def beginners... I read up a lot and watched many videos before purchasing & I knew that it wouldn't be a breeze getting used to using a Barlow lens, so I gave it some time.... after a week of putting in hours every night, it became pretty clear what was going on. There's a flaw in the glass (near the center)that's large enough to make it impossible to see even the moon... & the crack at the edge adds an interesting feel to the night sky. The rest of the eyepieces & filters are in great shape though. Our 7 year old is pretty disappointed that I couldn't get it to work, but at least he got to see Saturn's rings a little better through the 6 mm.Bought this set specifically for the Barlow lens & I find myself wishing we had just ordered one of the off-brand sets & saved $40.
