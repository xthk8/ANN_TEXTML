Not able to print using Hotel's free wifi-Others at crop was able to use there's using bluetooth.I printed 4 pictures at home and loved the quality of the photo's but I purchased this printer for taking it to crops and being able to print and scrapbook my photo's right then & there! I was very disappointed and when I came home from my weekend away I purchased a bluetooth printer that several other ladies at the crop had.
