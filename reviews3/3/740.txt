There was only one included cartridge. I was able to print only 6 pictures before it either ran out of ink or had a mishap with the cartridge roll itself. The cartridges are also not that inexpensive to replace. I purchased a bundle advertised by Amazon with two extra cartridges and they were for the wrong model. The photos were going to be for a Christmas gift and I nearly had a panic attack trying to find a replacement cartridge to finish the project, which were nowhere to be found on short notice. I almost debated on buying an entirely different printer but then swallowed my pride and had the pictures sent to Walgreens, which was embarrassing as heck, but saved the day.The other huge drawback is that the photos take forever to print. It prints one picture at a time, obviously, but it takes several minutes to do so, and you cannot for any reason leave the printing screen or even close your phone or else it will fail. The photos are also slightly smaller than traditional 4x6 photos and did not stay in place when I put them in a photo book. The pictures I printed with the Sprocket had to be taped into place while the Walgreens pictures fit perfectly. Still debating if I want to keep it or not. The cartridges are not worth replacing if I can only get half a dozen prints out of it at a time.
