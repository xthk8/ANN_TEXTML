I can fit my iPhone 14 Pro Max. The side handles are easy to install and to use, somewhat comfortable . It has several cold shoe mounts and threaded holes to mount it on a tripod .So far there are two things I don’t like. First is the threaded stud on the top of the right handle. It can’t be removed so if you don’t tighten something on it, it will be making noise at the slightest movement.And secondly is the Bluetooth remote shutter button because it doesn’t stay on and of course, connected. This is extremely annoying if you want to rely on it because if you’re recording an event and only the desired scenes, the button won’t work when you need it.
