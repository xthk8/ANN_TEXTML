The buttons on this camera aren’t right. It’s difficult for me (an adult) to use and I’m tech savvy. For example: one button will say “zoom” and it won’t be zoom, another button that says “save” will be the zoom. (Those aren’t exact examples but it’s been a while since I used it and I can’t remember specifically which ones were off, but there were a few) Once you learn the camera it’s fine, but that was extremely annoying.Also the picture quality sucks. Honestly, it sucks. Maybe I’m just use to my iPhone camera but my gawd it sucks. I spent a bit of money on this camera and expected better quality...honestly I’m overall very disappointed. It was a gift for my son (age 7) and even he commented on how poor the picture quality was and we had a hard time teaching him which buttons did which thing.The battery life is good. The camera looks really nice...but the buttons are wrong and difficult to navigate, and the picture quality sucks. My digital camera has better quality and is easier to navigate...so I’d think a camera advertised for kids would be MORE simple to navigate, but I guess I was wrong.
