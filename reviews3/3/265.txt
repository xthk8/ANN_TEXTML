This product is ok and overall it did what I needed it to do. . . Eventually. The editing software really only lets you cut scenes out of the video. It is difficult to get it to stop where you need it to to cut the clip just right but it's do able. I bought this to save my parents 7 VHS wedding tapes to a flash drive for them. I also wanted to 'chop them up' into rehearsal, ceremony, receiving line, etc. About half way through the program was having issues and kept saying 'unknown error the program will shut down now' and then closing (thankfully it still saved my work) I called their customersl service number and got a lady in India that was incredibly hard to understand. She took my email address and sent me a test email. Once I got that she told me tech support would contact me soon by email. It's several days later now and still nothing. I uninstalled the program and reinstalled it and it appears to be working as it should again. I spent less than $40 on this, and overall I would buy it again but not for a penny more. I am glad I got this vs. just the cord so I could chop up the videos because most free video editing software will put a water mark on your video but thankfully this does not.
