The camera itself is nice I like the pan feature daylight picture quality is good night vision is not that great the solar panel itself is weak and it does not charge unless it's in direct sunlight I have solar panels that will charge in shade this is a cheap solar panel so if you do not have a place for it to go in direct sunlight you better have it plugged in direct for what I need the cameras good
