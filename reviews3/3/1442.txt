I bought this speaker to use with our Vibe board in the conference room as bluetooth speaker / mic has delay and echo issues. This was recommended from Vibe website and also figured having USB transmitter would be better. Using this speaker solves the problem of echo when in Zoom or Teams but the sound coming out has lots of static and is not easy to hear. I am not sure if I have defect product but I would NOT recommend this product.
