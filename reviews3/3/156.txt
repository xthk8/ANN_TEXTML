I submitted a refund request for the REOLINK 4K PoE Home Security Camera System, IP Camera, because there was not enough relevant information in the description. If buying the camera alone, you'll need a plugin power cord; you don't get one at purchase. If you've read, you can power the camera using an RJ45 (CAT 5 or CAT 6) Cable; you'll need to purchase a POE Injector or POE Switch.Neither of these items is in the product description. They are, unfortunately, only referenced in the request for information by other customers, then researched via the internet.Suppose you're purchasing a REOLINK 4K 16 Channel Network Video Recorder for Security Camera System, HD Reolink IP Cameras PoE NVR, RLN16-410-4TB. In that case, it will provide the juice necessary to power your cameras, but it does not say so in the description.This product's description needs to be reviewed to prevent returns.
