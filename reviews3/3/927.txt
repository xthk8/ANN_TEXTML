We have been using projectors instead of televisions in our house for about 15 years and this is our third one. Our Panasonic and Epson projectors lasted years, but we had to change bulbs several times. The promised extremely long bulb life and good price convinced me to try Optoma.The brightness is excellent and the picture is very good, with one potentially serious problem: There is a flickering band approximately 100 - 150 lines tall that appears intermittently all the way across the screen at various locations. It only lasts for less than a second, but sometimes occurs several times in quick succession. I contacted Optoma support through their website and after a delay of over 3 weeks, I got an email reply that a technician would be contacting me within 24 hours. When I did not receive the promised follow-up, I called their hotline. The technician was very friendly and seemed knowledgeable. He suggested that the problem was probably the HDMI cable, and that I could test it by bringing up the menu when the flickering occurred to see if the flickering obscured the menu. Since the phenomenon lasts less than a second, I have not been able to do that. I did, however, have another cable. The flickering persists, but because of the delay, the 30 DAY warranty has now expired.The picture is very good and the flickering is unobtrusive, my wife didn't even notice it until I pointed it out to her, so we will keep this projector as is. The Optoma warranty would now require us to send it off for repair and we would be without any video for weeks! If the problem becomes worse, we will just buy a different brand.
