I used this camera for alittle over a week and it was fine until something was stolen and I thought I would be able to rely on this product finally for something useful and sure enough it doesn't catch any human detection during the most important scene, one minute the item was in view and 20 minutes later it disappears and this darn camera doesn't even show me how it happens ! I just go to the next clip and it's just gone !!! This is a pure waste of money if you want it to catch important views such as myself this camera along with the theif has cost me over 300$ smh. This is truly unacceptable and I am not getting rid of these cameras and going back my old brand that I never had a problem with ! I chose this because it cost alittle less. You get what you pay for , i would not recommend this product
