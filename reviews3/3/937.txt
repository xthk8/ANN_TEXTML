nexHT is now Ugohome, I guess. The app was changed since my first purchase, (I now own 8 of these), and not for the better. First and most annoying is the navigation. Originally you used a panoramic "mapping and/or finger swipe" now it requires left or right onscreen tiny buttons - over and over to get where you want. Next, installation: with new cameras, though the same model as before, you MUST use the new app. So I also had to load my old cameras back online via the new app. Not happy about that, as the navigation now is annoying for all 8 cameras. And lastly: for some reason when I activate motion-tracking on the new cameras (only), after 5 minutes of quiet sitting, they will independently return to the full left position of travel. All 4 new cameras. The old ones act properly and stay at the position left in. Needless to say, in order to watch my desired locations, tracking is off - which is not good for security.That said, these are GREAT cameras! I use them indoors and (sheltered) outdoors. Those even worked in minus 30 degree wind-chill!!! After using the first 4 for over 3 years, I did finally have to replace two that died. BUT the problem in both was a worn wire inside at the rotation base - which I repaired with solder and heat shrink!!Come on - $17 to $20 for a camera with good picture, durability and overall ease of use? No brainier... BUY THIS!! (Oh, and UgoHome: revert the navigation back, and fix that tracking problem, and you'll be perfect. Again).
