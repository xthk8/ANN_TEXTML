I loved my older LG HBS headsets. My last great sets were the 740s. But they failed at the interface between the band and the side pods and my last pair died due to that design issue. Unfortunately, LG seems to have moved towards reduced cost rather than having the best headset of the remaining in-ear, around the neck headphones. These are adequate and maybe pretty good in performance other than the buttons. The slight raised surface, especially on the right side, is hard to find tactilely and requires feeling around on the piece to ensure I am actually pressing the correct button because the + and - do not feels that different. On the old ones it was one rocker button. Easy to find the button, then push forward or back for + or -. Once you find the buttons, they just feel like mushing your finger into the surface. No obvious click feel to show that you have pressed the button. This amplifies the challenge with the new design removing the separate volume and track buttons. Now you have to press and hold to change tack. This is more challenging when you can't tell if the button has been pressed or not.If you are wondering why not just got to AirPod style, I love not having to worry about losing a tiny earpiece and the discrete black color makes them suitable for professional situations.
