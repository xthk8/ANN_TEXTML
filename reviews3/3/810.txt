This will probably work fine for a single output to two TVs. It does not work right for using a computer to connect to a monitor for PC use and a TV for streaming. The reason is that this splitter just has one input and two outputs, but no power connection and no EDID information going back to the source. So it will display your computer screen, but because the computer can't see what it's driving, you will get either no output or about a 640x480 resolution on your monitor. If you are outputting to a monitor and a TV, you need to get a splitter that also includes a power source for 2-way communication. I ended up getting this one from Amazon, and it works great: amazon.com/dp/B0732MD43P
