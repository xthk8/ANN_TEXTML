I measured the actual wattage with a watt meter and they measured a maximum of 50 watts each in the white light setting (rather than the rated 85 watts). The coolest and warmest settings use a maximum of 25 watts per bulb. Even though wattage is lower, the lights are still reasonably bright. The diffuser is a little cheap. You can see the a hot spot in the center where the light resides. I have not yet used these for video or photo. I expect they will get the job done for beginners, but they are probably not suitable at a professional level. My expectations are were entry level and that is what I got. I was disappointed by the false wattage rating.
