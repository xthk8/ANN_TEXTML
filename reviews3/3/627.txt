I bought this radio for my old Jeep, I like the retro look and thought it would go well with the simple interior. It was a nightmare to install, as the connections did not fit with the regular jeep harness, and it took a while to cut the old harness and splice all connections. The radio is under powered - you will need an amplifier to get your speakers going if they are over 50 watts. I would not buy again.
