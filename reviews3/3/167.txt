This is not a regular-use projector. Better for special occasions. I would use this as often as most people would use their TV. Less than 2 years of use and there are new dead pixels every month. I’m up to 9 now. If you’re going to buy this for regular use, it would be worth an extended warranty. You will need to return it after about a year.
