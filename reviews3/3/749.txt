I purchased this after doing due diligence. What I really need is a Sekonic light meter. I understand that this meter does not do any f stop calculations and gives only ambient readings in fc or lux. fine. I hoped that it would be fast enough to give me a reading on strobes. It's not. I'm not interested in an absolute number and only wanted to investigate ratios between lights. That's not asking much from a light meter. Possibly this would help when using constant light sources, but if you're looking for a cheap alternative to measure flash, you'll need a photographic light meter.
