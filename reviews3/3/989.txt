This is an extremely well designed stand in terms of positioning and an easy to use phone clamp. The one flaw is that bending the stiff, sturdy gooseneck puts a huge amount of pressure on the plastic table clamp. My table clamp broke after two months. If you won’t be repositioning it much, or you’re very careful to bend the gooseneck without putting pressure on the table clamp, it should be fine. They have a newer model that claims to have a stronger table clamp.
