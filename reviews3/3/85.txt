Poor quality audio and video compared to a Galaxy s7, s21 and iphone 6s and my laptop webcam and my nextgen webcam.We thought a handheld would be easier to use for making a video for use on a work training program. Good thing we had the Samsung Galaxy phones for backups.The sound was barely audible at the highest volume. Recorded sound and music directly uploaded so compared to videos made from all of the other phones and webcams.No matter what level of illumination (Indoor/outdoor and professional lighting) used for other purposes, the video looked dark and grainy.I worked with their customers service and they agreed that they could not help resolve the problem and the handheld couldn't record as well as our phones.**It was much more limited than the technology of Samsung phones and my nextgen webcam. Especially, with their superior ability to edit.**It won't even record a video longer than 30 minutes.**Customer service was very nice and helped get the return process started.Since this is a review of the product and not customer service.⭐️ I can't recommendEXCEPT if it is $10-20, for you kid, as a first recorder, before you get them a phone, just to play with as an early hobby. Even they will get frustrated with the quality.
