I probably should of read thoroughly. I thought it came with the rod and everything, especially for over $30. They feel nice, but very thin. I feel like I could have just gone to Walmart or ross for curtains but I thought I was buying the curtains and set up. Also bought the warranty for no reason. Iâ€™m only gonna use these one time.
