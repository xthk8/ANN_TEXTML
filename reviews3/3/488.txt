Not sure if it's just my lens/camera, but the included pancake zoom lens doesn't twist in smoothly and most of the time won't connect to the camera properly without a bunch of fiddling and tweaking and to get the pins just right and power cycling just so. When this happens the camera still kinda works but it breaks autofocus and causes a bunch of lag on the camera as it presumably tries to talk to the lens and fails (even lags on trying to power off). Manual zoom still kinda works in these situations.The camera works just fine with other lenses which twist in much more smoothly and don't have these issues, disappointed that the included lens is giving me so much trouble. Not worth the hassle of returning as I already had to return the camera once due to being delivered an empty box the first time.Otherwise seems to be a really solid camera with a ton of capability, but I did find the camera menus confusing with some settings (image quality) NOT being present in the main settings menu and instead only displayed in a completely different picture menu accessed through photo mode.
