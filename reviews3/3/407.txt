Let's cut to the chase. It's claimed that the Rode Wireless Go II does on-board recording. You'll have to do some hunting to figure out how, and then it won't be pretty.You have to download the Rode Central software and install it. Then connect the transmitter your computer and update the firmware. Then hunt until you find the option to turn on on-board recording.Once you've done that, there is no start/stop of the recording. Whenever the transmitter is turned on, it records. Turning off stops the recording. Each time you turn the transmitter on, then off, a new recording file is created in the transmitter's internal memory. It says it will record up to 7 hours (MP3).But wait! There's more! Want to actually access your recordings??? The only way you can do that is through, once again, the Rode Central software. When the transmitter is connected, you'll have an option to convert and export the .UGG files created to either MP3 or WAV files. However, I've not found any option to delete the .UGG files from the transmitter, so I hope they overwrite when the memory gets full.It's an overly-complicated way to execute a relatively simple process.Otherwise the system seems to work fine. Haven't actually used it in the field yet, though.
