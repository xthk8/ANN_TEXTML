Ok, so I get it. This is mentioned (buried) in the product description. But this item is worthless without a battery pack or power cord. So why even bother? Amazon and the manufacture give you no input or suggestion as to where you should purchase these items. They don’t even give you guidance about WHAT batteries (they appear to need a special sized lithium battery - not exactly something you find in your battery drawer just laying around) or power cords you need in the description so you can track them down yourself while you purchase it. I mean, talk about poor customer service and product design!Maybe this is a common thing for professional photographers to deal with, but I am not one. This was purchased for work project where we were using a camera to take picture scans of a large folio. We bought it so we would not have to stand on a chair over the frame. Still ended up standing on a chair because we opened the product only to discover we had to track down additional specially pieces just to make it work. Which means it is worthless to us. I don’t need to spend precious time tracking down parts that should just be included with an electronic device. So it will be returned.
