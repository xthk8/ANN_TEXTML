I do like the range of flexiblity and movement for the lamp itself, however its far far dimmer than I had anticipated compared to my previous lamp. I also had to set up the lamp on the end of the stand, as trying to attach it to the flexible clamp just would not stay in place or support the weight of the light. The most disappointing part was the phone clamp, and definitely the cheapest aspect of the product. It is very tough to open and feels equally flimsy to do so, and again using the flexible clamp- is really hard to keep the position of for the phone just as much as it was for the light. I'll see how the lamp itself holds out overtime but likely will invest in a fully separate phone stand in future
