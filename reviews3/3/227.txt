I always write positive reviews and typically have great experience with all products.... not the case with this one. Many product flaws. The product overall isn't that great at all. It is fairly easy to assemble though it gets crazy when trying to put the top bar together as it is huge. I would suggest having two people to put it together. The product is very lightweight but that actually has more downsides then anything. The bar across the top has ZERO support so it droops down and messes up trying to create an even background as it causes wrinkles from the drooping. The product is also so lightweight that it easily falls over which is not ideal when trying to use for photography. There is supposed to be a bag that comes with to help for easier travels with this and that really doesn't operate correctly. Not all of the parts fit into the carry bag and the ones that don't seem like they are supposed to be wrapped and secured on the outside of the bag but that doesn't work either as they are too thick and then it cant close correctly.
