The jaws open up just barely wide enough to hold my son's 2022 Moto G with it's case on. It also struggles with the weight of a modern 2020s phone, toppling easily because there's no mass in the legs. The manufacturer should put weight in the feet so you don't have to struggle to get the feet spaced widely enough for the tripod to not topple over.
