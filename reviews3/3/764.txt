I have an the 10.2 inch 9th edition iPad and this cable is not capable of charging it fully. I have had it plugged in for over 12 hours on several occasions and it barely gets it up to 30%. My kids have older iPad minis and it's the same issue, doesn't have the capacity to charge them properly, either.
