Bought this for use in work-from-home office for high quality audio. The sound quality was good, mic was boom mounted overhead just out of view of the camera. But there was always noise/hum present, with an external camera power supply (which was a requirement in this setup), when using it with a USB audio interface. Switched to a dynamic microphone and noise/hum issues are gone. Tried another power supply and cable, problem still follows the mic, so I returned it. I kept using the dynamic mic with good results...
