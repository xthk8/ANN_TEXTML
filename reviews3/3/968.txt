This printer functions like many other printers. When it works, it works great. But it suffers from loading problems and often does not print, shooting out blanks. It will often state there is no printer paper when loaded. It will often print out blanks vs pictures. I spend more time powering it down, resetting it, and trouble shooting than I do printing pics. When it does work, the print quality is at par. But it consumes a lot of time trouble shooting.
