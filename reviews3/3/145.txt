Itâ€™s great for those vintage looking pictures. Got the artsy look. The camera is really small which I love since I can put in a purse. Only thing I took off a star or more is that I have to hold the bottom so it can read the film cartridge to take a picture. The pictures do not come out clear or colorful but I like taking pictures for that vintage look. The film is small too. But I knew this when I bought it. For those who love to take pictures for art sake this will do.
