As you can see from the photo above. This cord is short about 4 feet!!! Not a 5 foot one like was in the ad!!! If it was not for the fact that I needed a longer cord than I had already had like last week I would of sent it back. Anyway I can make this 1 foot cord work for my setup so I will keep it. I cannot afford to be down on my setup waiting a few extra days for them to fix the problem and sending me the right item. The product otherwise is a very great product ( I payed only $20 for it so it still has value for the price I payed). Beside the small mix up I would still tell all to buy the product but check it right away to make sure they send you the right item because maybe you are not like me and you need the full 5 foot cord. I would given this product a 5 start, but as I said above the cord is a 1 foot cord.
