Let me start out by saying the lens is great for the price and takes great pictures. The 3-Star review is for Amazon. I ordered this lens for a trip we were taking and was due to arrive the day before we left. The lens arrived and I opened it to find someone had opened it, repackaged it poorly and the rear dust cap was MISSING. I've ordered other lenses from Amazon and have never had this problem, so I was pretty shocked to find I was shipped a USED lens. And just to clarify, I did not order this from the Amazon Warehouse. I was then going to order a replacement lens and have is shipped to my vacation location, but when I attempted to order another one Amazon would not let me make the purchase. I finally decided to order it from the New York photography store I usually purchase my equipment from and received the lens in 2 days. A customer should never receive a used/opened piece of equipment unless they are buying it from the Amazon Warehouse.The lens I purchased from another company arrived and it takes great pictures. For a non-L-Series lens I was surprised at the quality of the pictures and will probably use this with some of the models I normally photograph. It was also great as a travel lens and is light-weight and compact, especially when you compare it with the weight and size of the L-Series RF 50mm F 1.2L.
