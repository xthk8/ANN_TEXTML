Quality is not that great. If you’re getting this just bcoz it is braided, then don’t. The braiding is really cheaply made. It’s just a sheathing on a typical flat Romax type of cable. It does not have a smooth flow like a good braided cable is.Other than quality, I haven’t had any issues till now. It’s been a week and rest all works as expected.I would recommend trying other brands than this one.
