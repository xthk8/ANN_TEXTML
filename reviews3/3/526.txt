I was so excited to read reviews on this camera and the zoom capabilities listed. Two months in and the wifi connection to SnapBridge doesn’t function. I’ve tried every troubleshoot technique available. I am returning and wish I had read reviews on Reddit before purchasing. It appears there are defects with Nikon software. I have a canon camera and have no issues with connecting to wifi to download pictures. One other issue is the camera gets out of focus too easily. I see other reviews mention this. What good is a zoom lens when you can’t focus on your subject?
