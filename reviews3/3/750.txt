... The decimal point is ridiculously small relative to the digits. It is very hard to see it in bright or too dark surroundings. It is totally unnecessary as this meter not accurate to fractions of a decimal. If you keep it under constant light it is going to fluctuate by 10-20, so the 0.1 is meaningless. So it becomes a problem if you can't tell if the reading is 3002 or 300.2 with the tiny decimal. You can save readings and then examine them later under better light, but if this part of the design is so poor it makes me wonder how accurate the reading is too. Also it's not clear if this is calibrated for accurate reporting of LED lights, which is a whole area unto itself (most of these meters are meant for halide or fluorescent lights).Otherwise it seems ok for a $30 meter for rough estimate of visible light to the eye, but you are not going to get the accuracy of a $500 PAR meter that detects detects almost all photons over a wide range of wavelengths (worth learning about the spectral response curve if you are doing something mission critical).
