Although it is advertised for horizontal and vertical recording this set is not the best to record REELs. The setting for vertical filming is not very sturdy and if you do not have a good professional tripod the set will tilt due to the weight of the microphone/light/ phone.Sound and lighting are great though, hence the 3 stars review
