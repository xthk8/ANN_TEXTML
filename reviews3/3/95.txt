tl:dr This camera is great for close ups. Awful for landscapes and low light.The macro photos are bomb with this camera. I could see why this would be awesome for diving or detail work. In fact, we've been impressed with the macro (aka super close up) abilities of this little camera. Unfortunately, we have been unable to get it to take a sharp image for landscapes. We do a lot of hiking and chose this camera for it's ruggedness and outdoor specific build. Whenever I open a landscape image that we've taken, I've always been disappointed. Tried both the RAW (ORF) format and the JPG. Tried adjusting settings manually, as well as using the auto and landscape tools built in. Nothing is giving me a good landscape shot. When I zoom in, the definition just isn't there. Maybe this is my fault for expecting something closer to my old dslr output.Also have been markedly unimpressed with it's low light capabilities. I haven't saved any of those photos to share here unfortunately.It does have fun features like a compass, altimeter, and logging capabilities. It can track your hike and add details about where you took it like coordinates, altitude, temp, etc to your picture's meta data, so that's nice.Until we find something better, I guess we'll continue to carry this one, but it's not what we wanted it to be. Wish I could return it and look at a different Olympus product.
