The cable works good and provides the unit with a constant charge during temps only over 32 degrees Fahrenheit. The cable will not charge during temps below 32 which is very disappointing given it’s winter and the temps in my area are below 32 degrees. I was not aware of this charging issue before buying the camera or the charging cable. Time will tell if I’ll still have to take it inside to charge the battery regularly during colder weather. The magnet to the cord is strong and holds well to the unit. Other than the cold weather charging issue, the main thing I dislike is the price. $50 for an “extension cord” that only works in warmer weather is kinda crazy but I need this because I found that the battery in the Arlo 3 Pro doesn’t last nearly as long as the company claims it does. Even with nominal settings, I was taking the unit down and charging the battery weekly.
