I loved my old pair from years ago, but that's definitely in the past. These are great from afar, but far from great. The volume was subpar. The earpiece is uncomfortable compared to other neckband headphones I've had. I don't know why LG decided not to angle the attachment point, but here we are. The retractable buds were more of a pain than a benefit. If the wire wasn't so incredibly thin, it might be slightly improved. However, I felt like I was going to break my headphones every time I took a bud out. I get more benefit from the Mpow Jaws. Same idea with less flash leading to a more sid product.I wanted to love these headphones, but I couldn't. They're just not great. I will say the audio range is pretty good, but not any better than other cheaper options. If you don't care about magnetic buds, get the Soundcore from Anker. They sound just as good, and seem to be better made.
