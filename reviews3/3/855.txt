This was a great buy for the price but the sound quality is not very good, sometimes the device power-up and lowers the volume without me touching either the volume button on the headphones or my phone and not sure what that is. This may be a malfunction as my pass IPhone headphones never had this issue. Not sure what to attribute this to!
