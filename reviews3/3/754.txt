I couldn't mount my camera in any position that allowed the "Quick Release Plate Lock Knob' to tighten. It hits the bottom of the camera no matter how I position the camera or the 'Quick Release Plate'. Pulling the 'Lock Knob' out made no difference. I had to reverse the 'Tilt Bar' so that it's on the left side, and rotate the 'Ball Head' so that it is backwards and the 'Ball Level' is on the side facing away from me.The 'Ball Level' is in a position that is very hard to see straight-on without tilting the 'Ball Head' as far down as it will go.I am disabled and have a hard time standing up so I have to use a tripod while sitting down. The 'Mid-Level Spreader' is in the way of my legs and makes it hard for me to get close to the camera when using it.These things aren't serious enough to go through the hassle of returning it but I wish I had spent more time researching different tripods to find one that was a better fit for my uses.
