The 2 screen protectors included with Watch are phenomenal! Best I have seen. Getting the watch face downloaded was not included in any instructions and tedious. The watch face is very much nicer looking in photos, in person it’s not very authentic looking. The band is great for protection but also looks a lot like a Casio watch. Meh… probably will use the clear covers and put the band in my unused drawer.
