Decided to go with these since my old BeatsX headphones dies. Think the battery went out and wouldn’t turn on. In comparison, the sound quality is not as good as the BeatsX. It lacks highs and mids in comparison to the BeatsX. It seems a little muted in comparison to the BeatsX. There is plenty of Bass with the Flex.Another thing about the Flex is that they don’t have a separate control switch for play and volume control. It’s just integrated on the left battery pack area. So in order to adjust volume or play/pause, etc. You have to reach next to your neck in order to access them. It takes a little longer find the location since you have to grab the cable and slide your fingers down the cable until you find the switch location on the battery pack. The old BeatsX had a separate area higher up on the cable closer to the side of your face which was easier to access.At least it has the W1 chip so you can share music with multiple headphones and you can use Find My app to find your headphones(only if it’s on.) Or see the last known location while it was on.The main reason why I went with the Flex is that it has a much longer battery life than just the separate ear buds, plus you can easily take if off and let it hang around your neck without having to stick it back in case. With the 12 hour battery life you can take it on an airplane trip and it will last pretty much the whole flight from the time you are waiting to get on the plane and while you’re flying.Overall it’s a decent entry level product. It’s the only around the neck ear buds that Apple now makes. It’s good enough for what it is. But it would have been nice if they still sold the older BeatsX headphones which cost a little more and had better sound quality.
