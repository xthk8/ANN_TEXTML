How is it that Optoma would produce a projector at this price point with NO horizontal keystone adjustment, NO WiFi ability, an Auto Keystone Feature that does NOT correctly adjust the picture size, and sound quality from the speakers that sound like a transistor radio. Also, if set to Gaming Mode, the zoom feature no longer works, which effectively disables all adjustments you've made to fit the screen you are projecting to. On the plus side, the picture is vibrant, bright, and the fan noise is incredibly quiet... all of which makes it incredibly disappointing that this is not a fully functioning product. Reluctantly, I must return this projector and continue my search for a high quality product with basic functionality.
