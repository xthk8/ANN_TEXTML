may have been the one i received, cause when i powered up the very next day, the resolution stayed at 720p, had to send it back. other than that, the picture is ok, i used a soundbar for sound, the set up was very tricky as this aint really made for home theater as i hoped, resolution, as i mentioned before kept switching. so maybe it'll work for you, maybe it wont.
