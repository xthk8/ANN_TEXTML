This is a super sweet little microphone. It really is. There's a design flaw that's becoming hard to ignore, though, and so I thought I'd write a review about it. Any movement you make (walking, moving around, jostling any part of your body while holding the unit this microphone is attached to) will cause this microphone to bounce, and that bouncing sound gets recorded. It's a very low level sound when it bounces, but it's there, it's unavoidable to notice - you really can't miss it. And if you care about the quality of the videos you're recording... as in, if you're recording for the purposes of uploading for public viewing (Vlogs, TikToks, YouTube videos, etc....) this is going to play a role in your presentation if you're moving around while recording.However, if you have this microphone in a set position and you don't move it around - it's going to do the job just fine. I prefer this microphone over a few of my others and am currently seeking a work around to still be able to use it while also avoiding the bouncing around it does as I record my videos 'on the go'.
