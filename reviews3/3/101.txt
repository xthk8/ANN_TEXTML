I purchased four cameras and an NVR from Reolink. The hardware looks pretty solid and well made, but after 4 weeks of trying to get help from the company I'm left with a system I cannot install. I'm pretty tech savvy, but not in security systems. Reolink does not afford customers the option of phone support, so I was limited to email. But they only answer one email per day.I had some questions before I purchased to make sure I was ordering exactly what I needed. After about 6 email exchanges, one per day, I went ahead and purchased what I thought I needed. It turned out to be wrong (I was told I need one injector for each camera when I needed none at all because the back and forth took too long to describe my needs.) Once I received my order, I continued the thread with the same support person (August). Once he found out I went ahead and bought the equipment, he transferred my case to Reolink's Amazon division, forcing me to start all over with a new person... one email per day. Deeply frustrated with the snail's pace, I pleaded with both reps to PLEASE allow me to talk by phone so I can have a dialog. It fell on deaf ears.I have the system installed, but I'm a long way off from getting it to work. I have no faith Reolink will help me complete the setup any time soon, if at all. Some things just can't be resolved by email. They require a conversation. If you aren't familiar with setting up a security system and don't have someone to help you, don't expect Reolink to come to your rescue. Great product; lousy service.
