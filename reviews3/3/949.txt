While printing holiday items on December 15, I needed to replace ink cartridges that were running low. Having anticipated this, I was prepared -- or so I thought. I opened this 3 cartridge pack and began replacing the cartridges in my printer. All worked as expected except the Cyan LC201C. Upon inserting this cartridge my printer gave the message "wrong cartridge" I pulled it out and reinstalled it only to get the same "wrong cartridge" message. After many tries and inspections of my printer I at last gave up and had to put my Christmas printing on hold until a fresh set of cartridges could arrive in the mail which, as I learned, will be Saturday at the earliest, too late for my Christmas printing and mailing. This was a set of three brand new cartridges that I received on Monday and removed from their sealed plastic wrapping on Wednesday. They are absolutely the correct cartridges for my printer, I made sure of that when ordering, and I have ordered the exact same set for years. The other cartridges in he 3-pack worked fine, the Magenta, the Yellow, and also the black cartridge which I purchased as a single item on the same order. Only the Cyan will not work, my printer reports "wrong cartridge" even though it is a Brother Innobella cartridge of the correct type for my printer, a Brother MFC J480DW. There is clearly some fault in the manufacture of this cartridge, as the one it was to replace, the exact same LC201C, is recognized by my printer but of course it's empty, which is the entire reason why I bought a set of new cartridges for my traditionally large Christmas printing. I am trying as hard as I can to refrain from using profanity, but I am extremely unhappy with this issue. If there is any way on earth that you can get an Innobella LC201C or LC203C (Cyan) cartridge to me before Saturday the 19th I will be most grateful
