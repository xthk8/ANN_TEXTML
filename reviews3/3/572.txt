The color filters won't fit in the housing - dimensional problems. Sigh. But, the white is 5600K and they're bright enough to be useful. The problem for me is that I want to use them as small 'fill' lights to supplement my bigger LCD panels, and turn them all on and off with one power strip. But these lights have no mechanical power switch, you turn them on by pushing a button, and when you kill the AC they retain no memory that they were "on" and at a certain brightness level. To make things more irritating, the control switch is about 4' down the cord, you have to hunt for it every time. Now I'm wondering if I could cut out the control pod and just jumper the wires directly so they're always on.
