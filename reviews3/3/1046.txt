The holes did not align with my Panasonic TH-42PH20. I experimented using varying sizes of washers to angle the screw input, but the hole spacing is just off for my model. When looking downward before adding the screws, I could tell that it didn't align, but I was hopeful.I see there are several comments about other Panasonic models that this did not work for, as well.It's a shame because it does appear to be sturdy.
