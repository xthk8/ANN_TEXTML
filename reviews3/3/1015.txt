I chose two different OD green case/straps to try out with my Ultra watch. This one looked the best but I returned it for the other brand because I didnâ€™t like the metal sliding loop that secures the band. After just a few minutes of wearing it, the metal loop was noticeable and pinched my arm hair out several times. Still felt solid overall and looks great.
