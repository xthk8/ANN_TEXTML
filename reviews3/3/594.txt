This is not a stellar light, but it is decent when it is working properly.My home office is arranged with a window to my left when I sit at my desk. The room's overhead light is to my right but slightly behind me. This creates a scene with some major shadows on my face during video calls. I need a light that can fill in the shadows so my face is lighted more evenly.Even at its strongest settings, this light does not do that. It helps, and reduces the shadows, but it definitely does not eliminate them. And on bright sunny days, I'm not sure I can tell a difference at all.Then there is the issue where it sometimes works properly and other times it turns off almost immediately after turning it on. I've tried making sure the battery was fully charged; I've tried running it while connected to USB power, and nothing helps. Then the next time I use it it works fine.It has a small screen to navigate the controls, which are decently intuitive. The light color and intensity can be adjusted, and it shows the battery charge percent and time remaining.It's a decent light, if you don't need any strong lighting and if it would just work every time I needed it.
