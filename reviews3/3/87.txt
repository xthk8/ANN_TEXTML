The chest strap is super nice. I doubt the quality is super worth it. But unless you have an extremely small phone…. There will be soooooo much weight hanging off of your forehead and the strap on the head is wonky in the way it fits when there is weight applied. All in all, great quality, the head strap is just a throw in and you don’t want it.
