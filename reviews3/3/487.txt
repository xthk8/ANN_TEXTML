I have a Celestron Nexstar SE6 with a Celestron zoom 24mm-8mm. I got this Barlow to increase the magnification a bit further (pretty much close to the max recommended magnification for this telescope).It does the job at a cost, image gets quite darker (makes sense, you are not increasing the telescope light capture surface, your are just expanding the tiny slice the Barlow gets), but what disappointed me the most is the focus. It is pretty much impossible to get a decent focus on the image, and it looks a bit distorted.I am not sure whether all Barlows behave like this, but at the end of multiple attempts I just took it out and decided not to use it, I just use the zoom down to 8mm.In terms of construction, it's alright, fits well, secures well.. but on the image quality side, I am not impressed.
