I took this to an event to record a few interviews with my panasonic gh6. After the 4th recording the card wouldn't read anymore. I only used up less then 10gb of the card. I can't even get the files to back up on my computer. Lucky my camera let's me record to two cards at once so my backup express card still has the files and works fine. But this card I cannot seem to use it even after formatting it.
