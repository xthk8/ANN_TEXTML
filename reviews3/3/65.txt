The Gopro is simple to use once you read the instructions and understand them however, opening the battery chamber is next to impossible unless you have very strong fingers. It defied my hands and fingers until I finally very carefully, used a screwdriver to pry the latch. The door on the Creator-edition which you need to open to insert and remove the GoPro was also very stiff initially but improved after opening it a few times. I understand the need to maintain the water-resistant rating but there has to be a better way. Hopefully with the ability to connect a charger via the Creator-edition case and the Volta grip which provides additional power I will not need to open the door very often. The clips provided for attachment to a helmet are also impossible for me to use because they are so stiff. Maybe the GoPro is meant for the younger crowd and not a 73-year-old. Other than the above issues with getting started, my first impressions of video quality and still quality are that it is excellent. Especially for a camera about the size of a deck of cards.
