Yeah I was looking to buy this projector because I wanted to use it with my Iphone and of course in the fine print it says that I would need an adapter, great advertising lmao so stupid. On top of that it advertises that you could use a firestick yet they put the power connection right next to the HDMI so it doesnt fit. Really dumb design overall so much potential for something like this but not for 3 year olds running this company.
