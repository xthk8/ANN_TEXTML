It worked great with my Canon T7i even though you heard the clicking of my shutter but you could turn the volume off when watching a football play, which I am shooting. However, when I bumped up to a faster shutter camera, the whirring of my shutter caused so much vibration during the videos that they were almost useless. I couldn't pad it because there was little room left for my iphone 11. Great product when not shooting the play, however. Everyone loved the concept!
