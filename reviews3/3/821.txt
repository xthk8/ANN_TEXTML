My favorite new drone… it’s not as software enabled as I would like and according to DJI on their forums they have no plans to enable 3rd party app support through a software developer kit (SDK) anytime soon or ever. This makes the new Mavic 3 series far less superior than previous versions such as the original Mavic, Mavic 2 and the mini 2 or air S series. Based on the lack of SDK and ability to use apps like Litchi, this drone is nothing more than a big toy that you will have to register to fly (above 249g) and be tracked by Remote ID.Disappointed with no SDK support, will most likely return before Jan 31st if no progress is made on updating the customers with viable software solutions because the DJI Fly app is pretty weak.Update: returned because Dji has no plans of supporting an SDK on this consumer model.
