I work from home, my set up is one laptop and two monitors connected to that laptop. All three of these things are within 3 feet of my desk chair, on top of my desk. I say this to give some idea of what I'm working with in relation to my likes and dislikes of this headset.Likes: I enjoy mono headsets because I used to train phone agents and I liked being able to hear what's happening around me. This headset has a great sound and seems to tune out any noises that aren't pointing right at the mic (pets, kids, background, etc.) It is light weight and feels almost like I have nothing on my ear, but enough that I'm not going to forget about it either. Battery life is pretty good, I can get 4+ hours on a full charge, and if I'm working more than 4 hours straight, I should take a break anyway. And it'll recharge and give me probably 2 more hours in a 20 minute or so charge.Dislikes: The blue tooth in this thing is not great. It disconnects/reconnects throughout the day, the base that it comes in and charges from is sitting in front of me within inches of my keyboard, so I don't understand why the blue tooth does this day in and day out. I've tried to relocate things so I am positive there is no interference between this headset and either the base or the laptop itself. If I rotate in my chair and put my skull between the headset and my desk set up, it will disconnect. If I walk 3 feet away to grab a water from my mini fridge, it will disconnect. Not sure if it's just me or what, and everything else about it is absolutely amazing, but it is by far the most annoying thing about this headset.I ended up purchasing another headset that does not disconnect because this one drove me up the wall, having to ask people to repeat themselves because my headset had a stroke 20 times a day.
