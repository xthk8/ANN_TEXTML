Important to not that this stand does NOT come with a standard 5/8” -27 threading on the end of the boom to accept a mic clip. It is a 3/8” thread, meaning you need an adapter to use a standard mic clip.Additionally, the parts are not compatible with other low-end mic stands meaning that you can’t switch the boom out to another stand if you need to. Instead of threading on to the the stand the boom is integral, which means that you can’t pull the boom if you want to.Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this stand. As other reviews have said, you get what you pay for, but a different low-end mic stand is a better choice, as most of them are cross-compatible.
