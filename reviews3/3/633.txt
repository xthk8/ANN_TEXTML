I bought these for a Chrysler P-body car, which does not use any sort of baffle or enclosure for the rear 5x7's. Closed-back speakers would be better, but they're apparently unicorns.Sadly, both now have rattles from just the 4 x 40 power coming from the stereo. The screw holes don't seem to line up terribly well. The hard plastic "gasket" didn't want to fit with a couple cars I tried it in. I did not do much of a sound quality test on these, since they failed so quickly. 5x7 is an odd size.I should add that I did end up continuing to use them. Both are clean down to about 400 Hz and have a mechanical rattle below about 200 Hz. I used an electrolytic and let them do mid-bass up through full range. For this exact application, that was appropriate. The rear and door speakers can only be expected to produce mid-bass at best, making a subwoofer a perfect addition.
