The projector has no aux port or way to connect a bluetooth speaker? I ended up being forced to use an Amazon Fire Stick since you can connect a bluetooth device directly to the fire stick. An expensive and unnecessary cost for such a seemingly easy fix on Epsonâ€™s end. The fan noise is also decently loud and annoying especially if you are using the default audio as it is very quiet. The image quality and brightness are the saving grace of this projector. Just be prepared to buy a fire stick if you plan to use this to stream/for movies.
