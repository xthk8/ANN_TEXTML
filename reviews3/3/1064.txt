it fit the tv fine, but it was alomst too big for a smaller tv (27"). The feet are like 14" long and the legs off the back are designed as one size fits all, so as to fit a larger tv, it had to be pretty big. So if you have a smaller tv, I don't recommend this, if you have a 45" or more, it would be great
