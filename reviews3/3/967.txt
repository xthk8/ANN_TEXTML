I recently installed a bunch of these and a bunch of the G4 pro bullet style cams on a new facility. Suffice it to say we are going to get rid of most of these dome cams and replace them with bullets. The field of view is really narrow compared to the bullets. Even for close up or smaller areas like a covered entryway or vestibule….So before you buy these, look at the angles and do some measuring, and compare the coverages between the dome and bullet. You may find the bullet to be seriously overkill in your coverage need, but you may also find the dome to be seriously lacking in the footprint.If the coverage area is right however, these cameras have excellent picture quality, and I was able to clearly read the name and company logo written on someone’s badge flipping around in the wind as they approached the camera. Really nice frame rate and picture quality.
