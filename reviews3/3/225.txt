Motion detection is odd. It alerts me for the headlight reflecting off of my truck at night but when the truck leaves I get no alert.Playback mode it takes around a minute to watch 30 second of video and it seemed to be doing worse the longer I watched.Also 2 of the mounting screws broke trying to go into a fresh 2x4. I've noticed that you can always tell the quality of a product by the hardware they send with it.Clarity is ok. Even on the highest setting but if you mount it on your house you likely won't be able to make out plate numbers.The app is ok at best. No way to scan thru videos and no fast forward function so if you want to watch it's in real time. Worse actually since like I said to begin with it takes 60 second to watch 30 second of video.It has a motion tracking option which is kinda cool. Camera moves itself to follow motion. It gets confused very easy tho and just kinda twitches back and forth. I was also able to outrun it just by walking a normal pace so cool option but very little use. It would be ok if it were further away but then the poorish video quality would make it semi useless in a different way.The power feed wire is in two parts but isn't very long so the connection ends up on the outside of the house where someone could semi easily unplug it.These are the first cameras I've gotten but scoped out a bunch of friends system and this one is by far the most useless. We'll see if they last long enough for me to replace them with something better
