I'm reviewing this with respect to the price, and for the price it's really quite a nice microscope. Don't think for a second it will approach 1000x, and I deducted a star for the blatant lie. I don't know what the magnification is, but I'd guess around 40x, which is what I expected when I bought it for my son.I also deducted a star for the WiFi setup. The microscope is an access point, and you need to connect your phone to its WiFi, so you lose access to the Internet. When you're done, you switch back. I just dedicated an old phone to it to avoid switching.The picture quality and ease of use are quite good. If you need to look at bugs, tiny solder joints, or a splinter, it works fine. I prefer a loupe like the Kingscope LED Illuminated Loupe as it's easier, but it won't take photos. If you want to see diatoms and amoebas in pond water or cheek cells, it won't work.
