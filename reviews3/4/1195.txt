Product works great and appears to have great durability. Two items of note that may or may not be of concern to you. First, there is a green LED at the charging end of the cord that is always lit. I'm sure it uses a small amount of electricity but it's more than zero, as if it wasn't there. Doesn't change color when charging, just lets you know it's plugged into the wall charger. Second, the cord is not that flexible. It bends and can be would up but not real small circles without it springing back straight. Maybe 6" circles is about the most it likes. If you want higher durability and don't need to wind up the cord for storage this may be your winning choice. Enjoy.
