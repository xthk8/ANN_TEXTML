I do delivery driving and I am constantly taking my phone with me, plugging it back in, etc. This has been wonderful. It has made getting in and out of the car with my phone so much more pleasant. It closes automatically. You just press a button to open it again. No plugging in my phone all the time. My only complaint is that the charging is very slow. But my phone screen is constantly on so it keeps it from dying. I'd definitely buy again.
