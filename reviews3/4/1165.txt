This MusiBaby speaker is pretty good for what it is. I like how small it is and how long the battery life lasts. It's great for me to take to work and listen to while I'm working in my area of the building. This speaker is loud enough that I can hear it over the speakers of other people who work near me which is surprising for its size. The only thing I wish it had was more bass. It can sound a little thin when compared to other speakers. Other than that though I would recommend it.
