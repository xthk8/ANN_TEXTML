It’s so easy I was able to mount my tv with one hand since I have a broken thumb. Perfect TV mount with a nice release that allows me to remove the tv whenever I want. The only thing bad in my opinion was the knob on the back to adjust the angle wouldn’t adjust with the tv on it at first so I had to remove it first, adjust, then put the tv back up. Other than that it’s perfect in my opinion.
