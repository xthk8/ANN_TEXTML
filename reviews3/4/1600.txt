Sound quality is great but... Two things to keep in mind before buying these buds:1-Keep in mind that with this model you will not be able to control the volume from the buds, you'll have to do it from the phone. (If I just had known this before...!)2-They are not tactile buds: if you press on the logo area, it softly "clicks" mechanically, as a physical button, a flat one. That's OK, but if you use the buds to sleep aswell, and you rest your head on the pillow, the pressed physical button of the buds will make it react and it will stop playing your music (for example), or it will change to another mode, depending on the involuntary "commands" you'll be sending to your phone while pressing the buds against your pillow.
