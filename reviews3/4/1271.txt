I really like this phone so far and I think it is great value for the money especially for $500 when it was on sale. That being said I still think this phone has some room for improvement. The screen is nice but I think it could be a bit brighter and at least in my opinion the colors look a little dull. When it comes to the fingerprint sensor it can be a bit inconsistent but it hasn't been that bad for me. Also, the battery life is decent but if you want a phone with really great battery life there are probably better options out there. As for the positives using the phone feels very fluid and the camera is great. I also think the phone is a good size coming from someone that used to use a galaxy note 9 and felt that it was a bit too big. Overall, I like the phone and see it as good mid range option for most people.
