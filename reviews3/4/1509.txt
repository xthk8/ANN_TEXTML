I've found this stylus to be just as effective as the Apple Pencil for school work and occasionally drawing. The battery life is impressive and can last up to almost two weeks of use. One drawback is that it lacks pressure sensitivity, so it may not be the best choice for artists. However, it works well with apps like Notability and comes with extra pen nibs in case of wear. The included cap for the pencil end seems unnecessary to me, but it may provide extra protection for the pen nib. In conclusion, I would recommend this stylus for school and work purposes, but not necessarily for artistic use.
