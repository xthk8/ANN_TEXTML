Â I bought myself AirPods for the first time on Black Friday, and I am somewhat of a germaphobe, so when I saw these, I knew I just had to have them. They're so cute and small that they fit easily in your purse or backpack. The pink is so aesthetically pleasing to me. They seem like just the thing you need to keep your AirPods clear of unwanted gunk.The only thing I would say I don't like about them is that they are hard to open, as you can see in the video. Although I would rather they be hard to open than so loose that the lid never stays on, I fully recommend them.
