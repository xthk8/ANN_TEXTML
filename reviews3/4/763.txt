A good quality cable, but not as pictured. The nice “4K” logo is missing; however, the cable comes with the best packaging that I have seen for a cable at this price point. In addition to the usual plastics connector covers, the cable is packaged in a box with plastic clips holding the cable in place.Unlike other HDMI cables I have owned, the connectors are of the correct length and fit without bare metal exposed to collect dust.The cable is flexible and the sleeving is nice.The most important feature is that it works.
