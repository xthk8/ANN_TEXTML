I researched several headphones brands before finally settling on these ones. I will be totally honest when I say I did choose them in part because of the color and design of the headphones, but I have been so pleasantly surprised by the sound quality and noise cancelling.I have a pair of lower priced Audio Technica wired headphones and these SRhythym headphones pretty much match in sound quality. I had a bluetooth adapter for the AT set but it was such a pain to charge the adapter. Having built in Bluetooth is a game changer for me.I have struggled with finding good headphones due to sensory issues regarding the weight and comfort of the set, but these are perfectly lightweight and the ear pads are so soft and comfortable. They are truly over ear and I barely notice they're on. They also just look good which I can't say for every pair of headphones I've tried. They have a sleek profile, aren't too bulky, and the pale green color is stylish.Overall if you're looking for an affordable pair of Bluetooth headphones, this is my recommendation. I'll try to update in a month or so after I've used them for a while.
