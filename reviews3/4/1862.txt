Edit: I did drop to 4 stars. When lifting, I don't have any seating issues, but once jogging they do wiggle themselves out and you have to push back in. As I said, they are pretty bulky in comparison to others.So, I'm all about finding budget buys with good sound quality. My last Amazon over ear headphones took me 4 purchases and 3 returns before I found a pair I liked. They were $30 and lasted 4+ years. The left ear died on those so I was back on the hunt.I was skeptical about these because I hate having to adjust/push back in but it's what everyone is doing now. So here are my pros and few cons.Pro: price...seriously. At a fraction of the price as most anything mainstream out there, these easily hold up in comparable sound quality. And I'm an audiophile. The clarity is pretty impressive. They seat surprisingly secure in my ears after trying a few different size ear pieces. Sound cancelation is great. Battery life (at least for now) is awesome also.Cons: They are a bit bulky compared to others but seem to seat well though. The bass is lacking. Splitting hairs here at the price point, but yes I'd like a bit more. My biggest complaint on these is that if you go to adjust (especially push deeper into the ear) once connected, you will mute your music every time. It's a double edge sword. Super easy to mute by tapping outside of the ear bud. But equally annoying when not intentional.I really wish Amazon let you do half stars. These are not a solid 5 but the good much outweigh the bad. And I'm satisfied with it in general.
