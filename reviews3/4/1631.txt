This is my second pair. The first ones would occasionaly screech a very loud digital sound in my ears so bad I woul dhave to remove them. So I bought a second pair and they do the same thing. I am told it is "a thing" with airpods. Surprised that apple hasn't gotten into trouble with that. Other than the occasional screeching (once a week or so) I love them. People can hear me cleraly and I can hear them.
