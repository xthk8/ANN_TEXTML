This is neat, small, easy to set up and lovely for video calls for proper lighting.It's easy to use even while video calling. There is a white light and yellow light and you can adjust the intensity of the brightness. Just clip it onto the top of your laptop beside your camera and bam!It's small and not bulky. Useful if you video call a lot. I don't.
