These are a grade A pair of earbuds all around solid in every aspect I couldn't find one thing to complain about and I have over 20 plus earbuds and headphones to compare them to, all the major brands have their own identity that makes them seem special but to some degree they all have some form of flaws that's not highlighted, however, they all have their strengths as well, Soundcore liberty 3 sounds good, but the touch pad is janky, it refuses to do what it's supposed to do constantly. They have a good sound quality but that's it. JBL is my ride or die, but their flag ship tour Plus only sounds good when the noise cancellation and ambient sound is turned off, the Sennheiser momentum 3 has a good sound, but a lot of technical problems, the entire Jabra series is no match for the big brands, their selling point is the physical push buttons, that's it, if Soundcore would switch all their upcoming earbuds to physical button's they would corner the market for years to come because their sound quality is there their only flaws is the touch pad is not always responding to the touches, the JBL series will always be attracted to the serious bass head's, the truth is, all earbuds have some form of flaws, it's all about the price point, what you can really stand to spend to cater to your hearing sense's, if you are just into the sound quality just get a third party EQ app and adjust everything to your hearing preferences, volume, bass, clarity, etc, it will make any earbuds sound great, my EQ app is a beautiful sound, best EQ app hand's down. I would recommend these earbuds to anyone who wants a all around solid pair of earbuds.
