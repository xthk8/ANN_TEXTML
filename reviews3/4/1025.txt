Bose is my favorite company on the planet, and I love their noise-cancelling headphones, which I use regularly when I work from home. These earbuds are incredible. I have the first generation version of these as well, which were top of the line, but now if I use the first gen, I keep thinking the noise cancellation is off because of how much it pales compared to the new ones. My only complaints with these headphones is that they changed the battery indicator for the case, removing the usual five dots that gradually stop showing light to indicate charge, so I'm never sure when to charge the case (it's supposed to be indicated by the color of some other light, but honestly, the indication is entirely unintuitive when you use the same light for multiple functions), and the connectivity with the phone is somewhat erratic compared to the first gen. I'm hoping they fix the latter problem with an update, but I have had to disconnect and reconnect these headphones several times since I've had them because my phone will show them connected to bluetooth but the Bose app can't find them.
