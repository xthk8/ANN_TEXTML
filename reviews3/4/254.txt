Update: Was contacted by seller after posting review they are replacing the original free of charge and customer service was very helpful resolving this issue.good until it broke, has a weak spot wear the cable meets the clamp that holds it to the head board/desk cable snapped right at the connection on the inside and made it unstable. Lasted about 3 months only being used 1 time a day, if you get one I suggest putting your hand by the base to support it while bending it into position.
