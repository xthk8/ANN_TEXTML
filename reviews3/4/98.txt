First thing I noticed was the size. Very portable and light. It’s sort of flimsy when you increase the height. But, as long as no one bumps it or the wind doesn’t catch it, it’s fine! It’s not the most durable tripod out there. But, again, it’s just right for the price. You can see in the photos that it’s much smaller compared to the tripod I currently have. It’s also much lighter, too. This new tripod is more travel friendly. I mainly will use this product for gym content. I used it for the first time in the gym and it did great! It’s quick and easy to set up.
