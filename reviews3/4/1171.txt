I picked these up on a whim the other day at Best Buy and immediately loved the sound quality with music. The ANC is really amazing too - at least as good as my Bose QC35 II headphones, if not better. Also, the touch controls are some of the best I've used (compared to Pixel Buds and Sennhesier Momentum True Wireless.)Unfortunately the first pair I picked up had a glaring problem the next morning when I got on a Zoom call: there was a horrible "pinging" noise, like a spring or metallic sheet bending every time someone spoke. This occurred with ANC on and with ANC off.I searched for the issue and found people had had numerous pairs of earbuds with the problem - some worse than others. In my case, the problem was much worse in the left ear than the right. Others had a worse right earbud. It's easy to reproduce by turning all music and sound off and then clicking/biting your teeth together - even on pairs that don't exhibit the issue while people are speaking.The second pair I ordered here on Amazon also seems to be worse in the left ear than the right, but ultimately it's not causing the sound on calls so I may stick with them. Compared to the Momentum TW3 I would say the ANC is significantly (~50%) better, the controls are easier to use, Bluetooth connectivity seems more reliable, and there's a bit more bass. However, the Momentum TW3 has slightly better sound quality, and is advertised to have a better case battery life.
