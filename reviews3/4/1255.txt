The product looks nice and it's pretty simple to add your watch charger to it (it doesn't come with that built-in). However, I had to return it after a few days. It has two noticeable issues. First, the charging light looks cool in the daytime but lights up the room at night making it hard to sleep. There is a button you can press to turn off the light completely, but it must be done every time and then you can't see if your phone is charging. The biggest issue however is that no matter where we placed our iPhone 14 Pro Max, we couldn't consistently get a charge. It is no fun to wake up to 15% battery life when the charger said it was charging before you turned off the light. I gave it 4 stars since it does appear to work as advertised, but would not be my first choice to buy for this type of product.
