I just wanted something to put at my night stand for easy charging. It works but I find that it's a bit slippery so your phone could slide off easy. Also, the fast charging is not that fast IMO. I have a iPhone XS Max and it seems to charge faster with the cord. Not a big deal since I'm charging over night but I was expecting faster. The cable that comes with it is just long enough to reach the floor. it could be a foot longer. Other than that, it's okay. It will flash if it's not charging properly, which may happen if you have the phone in a case. I have to take mine out of the case to charge it but I have a metal plate in my case. it does work with my clear case though, YMMV.
