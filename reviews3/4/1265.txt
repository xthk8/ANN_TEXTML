I've had this phone for a little over a month now so I thought I would give my thoughts on it.I upgraded this phone from a pixel 5 and so far I like it just fine. The one issue I have with it the most is the fingerprint reader. I have learned to register my finger from multiple angles multiple times so that it works better. If you register your finger once you will have a lot of problems. I actually have three profiles for one finger. Also, I have noticed that after I wash my hands, the fingerprint reader doesn't pick up my fingerprint until my finger dries out all the way, which is annoying.The camera works well and I like taking photos with it. The phone is snappy and works well with the new version of Android. The screen is nice but has the same refresh rate as my old phone so nothing new there. The haptic feedback in this phone is much better than my Pixel 5. So far the phone is very stable and I am on the beta program so I get updates earlier. The battery life is good and I get over a day out of it but I am not a heavy phone user.Overall, I like the phone and it works well. I just wish the fingerprint reader was more accurate.
