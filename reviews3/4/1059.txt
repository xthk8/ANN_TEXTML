Well, I bought these so naturally i want to leave a glowing review (i never leave reviews) but i cant...i returned them.i have other Off-Brand wireless ear buds that do the trick, sound like ear buds, but i sometimes struggle with background noise so these JBLs were my first upgrade into the Noise Cancel territory. i didn't have much to base my opinion on.....im a musician so the JBL brand as Live Sound does have some recognition - i read lots of glowing reviews here and was convinced these would change the game. my main motivation to "upgrade" to noise cancellation tech is for use at the Gym where Stupid Workout Music is a health hazard - i have to play METAL in my buds just to drown out background noise...you get the point. i did not particularly need better sound, just MORE coverage....so i put on these JBL Tune 230NC TWS....they fit well, there is a noticeable upgrade in sound (the app is cool and lets you customize your EQ as you go) i flipped and fuddled with the noise cancellation settings my entire workout..A/B ing the room sound, on off type etc. i only detected minimal noise cancellation...again i have nothing to compare it to, i dont own Apple Air pods and likely wont at their ridiculous prices, but i had to be HONEST with myself that although these were a pleasant Sound upgrade, that was NOT why i forked out the fresh cash...i realized i could live with the cheap-OK earbuds i have and keep moving until the capabilities of the NC Tech are more clear to me...returned...Enjoy
