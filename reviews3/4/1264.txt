However, it does hold my 87" paper roll well enough as the weight is spread across and lands closer to the poles. Fabric of any weight would cause it to sag but it will still work.We'll only use this in a pinch when we need light weight and fast setup as it's not super stable and worries me. For the price, it's not terrible as i actually like the quick clips and telescoping poles.
