I ordered this amazon-recomended 128 GB card for my new Fire HD 8 PLUS tablet. When i installed it, the card properly "clicked" in as it should have but when I powered the tablet back up, the new card did not pop up as sucessfully installed as other users had mentioned. When I went to the storage folder in the settings, it showed the card as corrupted. I tried physically removing it and reinstalling several times but each time it still showed as "corrupted" in the settings/storage.I contacted the seller who immediately sent a replacement card. I carefully installed it but it still showed as corrupted. Frustrated, I clicked on where it said "corrupted" in the settings/storage folder to see if maybe it would give me some more information, though I wasn'e expecting anything because it didn't look like a link and was suprised when this action caused a message to pop up that said that the new card would need to be formatted to work and did I want to format it now? Well of course I did. I formatted it as internal storage and transfered the recommended apps there and it was installed. It would have been tremendously helpful if the formatting option appeared under or near the "corrupted" message.I feel bad that I had to return the first one to the seller but wanted to share this in case anyone else is receiving the "corrupted" message.
