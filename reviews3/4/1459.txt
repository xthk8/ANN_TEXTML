I like these since they clip on the vent and don't take up my cup holder. The only draw back is that when I turn on the heat in my car it heats up my phone. I don't like the phone getting that hot. Even when I turn my car's blower off, the heat is still coming out enough to make the phone get pretty hot. So I just have to make sure I turn my car's temperature dial to the mid-range whenever I have the phone in the holder. I see that weather tech has finally got one out that is NOT a cup holder and uses suction for the window so I might try that next but for now I have this and my two son's use them as well for door dash and they work great - just watch it so you don't heat the phone up with hot air coming out of your vent.
