They use a micro USB cable so the power is limited and surprisingly behind the times. But it is adequate. It takes a while to charge my Pixel 7 Pro. But I almost always put it on the stand overnight so being a little slow is irrelevant. The convenience of the stand is great. The current model has a light indicating it is charging which is a big improvement over the 1st unit I bought. It had no light. I have to admit though, that the light is just a nice confirmation. The charger seems to work fine even if the phone is well off center.
