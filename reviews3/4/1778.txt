I really like this thing, but a couple of small things that I wish were different:1. I wish the remote could be attached to the tripod somehow, because as it is, they are completely separate, meaning that there's room for misplacing it2. It works great with phones because phones are lightweight, but I've attached my DSLR camera to it as well, and given that it's heavier, I've noticed that it's harder to stabilize without it leaning in one direction, despite me tightening all of the knobs.
