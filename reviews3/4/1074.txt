I like that this product was easy to assemble. It is pretty lightweight so be sure to use the sandbags if your surroundings are a little windy. I used small paver blocks instead of sand because it's less messy.Gave it 4 stars because although the carrying case is nice, it has no compartments for the small hardware and clips, let alone the sandbags. You can tuck a small bag in the included carrying case when you velcro it together but it doesn't secure it during transport.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.
