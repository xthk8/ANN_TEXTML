I bought these to drown out the piped in music at my light industrial job. I needed something that I could hide under my hair while wearing one bud in one ear. These worked perfectly. With one in, I was able to listen to my own music instead of the repetitive country and oldies that were forced upon us. It drowned out the piped in music but with one ear free, I was still able to communicate and hear others speaking to me. There are buttons on the side of each bud to skip or control volume. Range seemed okay but I wasn't very far from my device while using these and the sound quality seemed very good if you're not a picky audiophile. I've used these for many other purposes as well. They pair easily. I always charge them before the batteries have drained but I get almost an entire 8 hour workday out of one charge. They came with different attachments for different sized ears. Definitely worth the purchase price.
