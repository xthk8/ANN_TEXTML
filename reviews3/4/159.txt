When I opened the package, one of the power strip cords seemed slightly used. There was fuzz around the on/off switch, and a couple of scratches that are slightly noticeable, but nothing extreme. The other power strip wasn’t like that and looked new. The cord length is not long at all, 1/3 of it is taken up just getting to the floor, so it’s better to have the things you need plugged in nearby already. But it does it’s job and gives you extra outlets. I will mention that at first it’s hard to initially plug things into it. It seemed like my plug just wasn’t fitting and didn’t want to go in, but after a LOT of pressure and pushing into the outlet, it finally went in. Definitely not an easy plug and go, but the cables don’t fall out easy either, so it’s very secure. I honestly thought I had a faulty cable because it wouldn’t go in with a normal amount of pressure, but it works fine once it’s in. I’d buy this again for some extra outlets, but I wouldn’t recommend this for someone needing a long cord that’ll stretch far and plug in tons of stuff.
