This is a solid Bluetooth ear piece. Good sound quality, however, there have been occasions where the other person could not hear me. It’s comfortable to wear,, however, it takes quite some time to place it on the ear correctly when answering a call. It would be much easier if there was no ear loop like the previous models. It is also not as light as the other models that don’t come with an attached ear loop.
