I purchased 2 different brands of these ear tips for my Airpod Pros 1st generation, only needing a size small. I noticed the other brand had the sizing etched on them (just like the original Airpod Pro ear tips), but also fit slightly better, more comfortable than these. These Yuwakayi are good, but I chose the other brand instead. Remember - you must pull the the white screen off along with the silicone ear tip to fully change them.
