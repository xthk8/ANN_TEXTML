I love this pen. Iâ€™m a designer and student, so I needed a better pen for my tablet. This was the solution! Easy to use, easy to hold. However, the nibs (tips) to the pen wear down fast for me, and when the plastic wears off the pen line will skip lines, break apart, etc. there are extra in the box, but only so many for each pen. It would be great if the company made a set of nibs you could buy separate from the pen.
