Great sounding headset with around 24 hours of battery life while noise cancellation is on. I use it mostly at the office to increase my focus and block surrounding noises.The headset is easy to pair with devices and has the ability to connect to multiple devices at the same time and the connection switching is seamless.There is no noticeable delay between the source and the sound on the headset. For example, if the headset is connected to your phone and you are watching videos, there is no delay between the source of the video (your phone) and the audio playing on the headset. So, the Bluetooth connection is very fast.The headset is very comfortable even after using them for long hours. The cushions are soft and the overall texture and quality feel premium.The only take is that the noise cancellation could be better. For example, the mics are not good at picking and canceling noises from all directions. For example, there are some angles that the mics do not catch the noise from and some of that noise can sometimes seep through. To be fair, these minor noises are really hard to notice but a higher quality of noise cancellation is always expected from such a premium item.
