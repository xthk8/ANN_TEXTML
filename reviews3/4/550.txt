Okay so I got these because airpods hurt my ears. The fit nicely and dont feel uncomfortable in any find of way. They can get pretty loud and if you have a phone or anything with a mic youre speaking into, You can still use call and such. But imagine youre using a laptop with these that has a mic on the bottom and youre trying to talk to someone through your laptop and they cant hear you. Thats where this loses the 1 star, how do you make headphones and dont add even just a little itty bitty mic. These are great aside from that, got mad cause then i just had to buy a gaming headset too so i could still play games with people on my laptop while talking to them.
