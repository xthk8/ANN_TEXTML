I recently upgraded from the xm4 to the xm5.I had several issues with the previous version (main one being their flawed, slow multipoint BT connection which caused more frustration than the headphones were worth) but some things they implemented on these xm5s are a bit of a head scratcher.PROS:Great sound qualityGreat noise cancellingGreat fit/comfortLong battery lifeSlimmer and less bulky than xm4Better, but not great, multipoint Bluetooth connectionDouble click for spotify is awesomeCONS:Multipoint - still has issues and I have to restart either the headphones or the device it's connected toNot compact/No longer collapsable like xm4 - bummer for travelingHeadphone case is ok but much prefer the xm4 caseThe multipoint was so awful on the xm4 I gave up on them out of sheer frustration. They would never switch to the other device properly and there were ridiculous delays - whether it's connecting or playing another device. It's one of the worst experiences I've had with multipoint BT.The multipoint on these are better...but there are still times when it prioritizes the wrong devices and I have to turn off the bluetooth on my computer to listen to music on my phone...even though the music is clearly playing on the device. It also notifies you every time a device is connected or disconnected from the headphones - which is great but I wish I could turn this off since it constantly pings when I go out to the laundry room with my loads of clothes and disconnect or connect to my laptop.I'm happy with these headphones but really wish there was a more elegant way to carry them around. I've actual gone without them due to the size of this thing which is a bummer since the sound quality is fantastic. I wish they kept the hinges from the xm4 so we can collapse them.
