The build feels solid. On my MacBook Air 13” 2022 M2 the two USB C ports are too closed together to use both adapters at the same time. I can use the MagSafe port and the adapter in the USB C port right next to it at the same time. I have a clear case on so when the lid is closed the adapter can’t fit all the way in because the case for the lid is blocking about 1mm. Fortunately I usually only need to use the adapter while I’m using the laptop with the lid open so it’s not a big issue for me.The midnight color doesn’t exactly match my Midnight MBA but that doesn’t bother me.So far I only used this to transfer some small files to and from USB thumb drives.
