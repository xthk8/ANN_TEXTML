Works great with my Galaxy S21 Ultra. My charging port was starting to have issues and not always charging the phone so I got this and the problem is solved. There is a light on the bottom of the charger so if you keep this on the night stand to charge at night, might need to block it. I use my eyeglass case and it helps for sure. Disappointed it is not hinged to pack for travel. It is rigid and bent at an angle and takes up a lot more room than a charging block or flat wireless charger. If you don't pack it carefully I am afraid it may break. Otherwise, it works great.
