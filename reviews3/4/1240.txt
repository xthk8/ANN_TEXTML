I purchased this to go with my 75â€™ Samsung tv. My father mounted it to the wall but needed to get two blocks of wood for it to have sturdiness. It is mounted 5 inches off the wall, not including the depth of the wood. The fixture is very sturdy but my father states it would have been nice to have this included in the online instructions.
