I really like this. I bought it to work with a Spigen Tough Armor MagSafe case for my new iPhone 14 Pro. (My last phone was a Samsung S8 Active, also in a Spigen Tough Armor case, but with no PopSocket or MagSafe features).I like the feel/added sense of a better grip on my phone. The PopSocket PopGrip is just enough to add a more secure grip, particularly in cold weather or when wearing gloves.One feature in particular that I find convenient is the ability to rather easily remove the MagSafe PopSocket PopGrip. It MUST be removed if a wireless charger is used for the phone, but it is easy to remove from the phone, and even easier to replace it.Both the Spigen Tough Armor MagSafe case and the PopSocket MagSafe PopGrip include features that serve as a "kickstand" for the phone. However, if the PopSocket PopGrip is attached to the phone, it prevents the use of the Spigen kickstand. While the PopSocket MagSafe PopGrip is easy to remove, some folks might consider 2 kickstand features as redundant/unnecessary. If so, they should consider a different case. Personally, I have no problem with the "redundancy". However, be aware that the kickstand in the Spigen case only allows for it to be used in landscape mode, and only when the PopSocket PopGrip is not attached. The PopSocket PopGrip works best with the phone in landscape mode, but can be reversed if the charging port needs to be oriented in a particular direction.With both the Spigen Tough Armor MagSafe case and the PopSocket MagSafe PopGrip, I feel my new iPhone 14 Pro is pretty well protected. If you're looking to protect an investment in an expensive smart phone, I would recommend both.
