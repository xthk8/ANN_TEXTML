NO EXTRA EAR BUD TIPS.I find that to be something that isn't mentioned enough. I bought these and liked how the stock ear tips came with a second screen inside of them.. until I realized it was the only tips they came with. Tried them on and they felt very loose and would easily fall out of my ears after feeling like they would the entire time. I didn't bother using them and bought a different pair of ear buds until I ordered a pair of relatively compatible ear bud tips. Samsung doesnt sell their own tips either for these so you have to buy your own low quality ear tips, which is disapointing because I genuinely am a fan of the type of stock tip it came with; MINUS the fact that they were too small.Once I did finally get the tips, these really are great quality, excellent sound, and small in size; both the buds and the case.Just not a fan of NEEDING to buy your own tips separately to even use them if they dont fit well.I would also like to clarify, I dont have uniquely large or strange ears, the Medium tip's that come with ear buds always fit perfectly for me.It's such a small oversight that made them UNUSABLE for me. But now I have a pair of these and Sony WF-1000XM4s.I can ONLY RECOMMEND these as long as you buy a set of extra ear tips.. and if you do, I can guarantee you or anyone will enjoy them and find them worth it.
