I didn't expect this to work, but it does. It holds a phone, was inexpensive and didn't promise anything it didn't deliver. I don't think I'd put one of the larger tablets or ipads on it, but most phones would be fine. It's got a weighted base, but it's not expecting a large touch screen - isn't designed for a device that large or that weight.It tends to tip when the screen of any device is pressed. But I'm a little stabby when using any touch screen because I hate them all so much, so it might just be me. I might try the removable gel glue to stick it in place better.I so wish the support rod had height adjustments but it just didn't cost enough to have that feature.
