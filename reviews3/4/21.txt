I started having trouble with my daily earbuds after repeated drops and abuse. While I'm waiting for them to be repaired or replaces, I decided to try a cheaper, temporary alternative. I've used them for a couple of days now. So far, they sound pretty good. Deep hitting bass was a big surprise for the price point. They sound better than the original Galaxy Buds, not as good as the Galaxy Buds Pro IMO. Connection range is exceptional. I haven't run the batteries down yet to be able to report battery life.A couple of drawbacks. One is the voice as soon as you open them, connect them, connect or disconnect calls. Really anything you do, there's an annoying voice in your ear. The other, which is big for me, is the lack of easily switching what they are bluetooth connected to. I use my earbuds all daily between 2 phones, a computer, and tablet. I'm used to hitting connect on what I need them for at the time. With these, you have to go through and disconnect them from one thing before they will connect to another. As I said, annoying, but not a deal breaker as a temporary solution and potential back-up. However, this is the main reason these will not be my primary earbuds.
