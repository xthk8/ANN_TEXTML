As long as you look in the booklet you'll find an email to set up the warranty.The only grief I have with the case that it does stay upright. But not the biggest issue.One step for setup/pairing and was immediately listening to music.I got here for the purpose if being my 'work set' for my work cell phone for when I need to work from home or other situations.Wow! The sound quality is great. I'm listening as I write! Give these a shot!! Especially if you don't want to spend a fortune on good earbuds.
