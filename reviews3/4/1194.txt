These cables were great for about a month, then seemingly on command the metal shrouds on the charger heads (The part that says SMALLElectric) started to come off. The glue that was applied when the metal sheath was slid on must have been faulty, or something to that effect. I was able to fix all 5 of them easily with a replacement dab of super glue, but spilled some on my finger. I may never emotionally recover.Worth the buy if you have super glue handy.
