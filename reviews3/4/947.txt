So the mounting system feels solid & works well for my choice of placement. Adhesive was really sticky & the arm only bends slightly under the weight of a Samsung Galaxy S22 in a Spigen case. We will see how it holds under driving conditions as well as how well the adhesive & suction hold up in high temperature later on, but from simply installing it in my vehicle, it feels like it was a better choice than the competitors. My biggest gripe as of now is the damage on the box: I ordered a brand new one and the box is pretty bent up right out of the bag, but I can easily blame it on the post office who handled it versus iOttie themselves. Also not as clunky as I thought it would be and is relatively easy to manipulate with one hand. I'd recommend this product now, however stay tuned for when I make an updated reciew after a couple weeks of use. CiaoUPDATE 22/12/17:So I have been driving with this mount for a bit and I have now noticed that the mount moves a lot left to right just from putting pressure on it. I have removed the arm and re-suctioned the base to see it it is giving out because of that; we shall see. Besides this, it has held up well and has been very convenient and easy to use. No other issues and on note of the suction cup, it is still very sticky and hasn't shown any other signs of giving out. Some cons I've noticed (besides the aforementioned) is it does shake a modertate to high amount while driving and the whole unit does bend a bit from the suction cup point, but I also would blame that on the fact that the arm is at full length. I still recommend this product to those looking around, but highly suggest you try to have the arm as small as possible to eleviate as much of the shaking and bend (center of gravity and all). I will update one last time when I feel necessary (probably when it breaks ngl). Have a wonderful day and stay happy and healthy! :)
