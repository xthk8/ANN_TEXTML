So let's get the easy stuff out of the way. Yes the ANC is great. Yes the sound quality is good.That said this is a long term review about the longevity of these buds. Which unfortunately is disappointing for how expensive they were. Compared to my old Samsung Buds Plus which I bought before these and still use as my gym buds, these had tons of issues that cropped up. The first problem was that the foam tips wore down and fell apart. Sure you can use the other tips that came with it, but those eventually break down too. I had to buy after market tips a year into using them. Then there was random junk like only one earbud connecting to the source and having to put them in and out of the case.But oh wait we aren't done yet. Then there was the problem where you would put the buds in their case and on bud didn't charge at all. In fact it would run down to 1% and be useless when you go to use them. At first I thought it was a problem with the metal contacts on the buds, but both buds took turns doing this.And now finally I have a problem where the right earbud just activates it's touch control randomly without being pressed and it's annoying as crap. It will randomly just turn the volume all the way down and you will just hear random beeping in the ear. It's starting to become a huge problem.I really liked these earbuds when they worked. The ANC on airplanes was awesome. But the problems with software bugs and longevity is really disappointing for such an expensive earbud set. Like I said my Galaxy Buds Plus which are even older are still going strong and those are almost $170 cheaper. Sony made a good experience when it works, but these things do not last long.
