A Samsung TV I purchased a year ago on Black Friday has several complaints about Amazon prime video buffering, of course their own Samsun TV Plus app works perfectly go figure. Anyway I noticed I was using old cables to connect my tv to the internet and where I live the wifo can be hit or miss, let alone with this particular model.I took the chance and bought these cables to connect directly from my apple Time Capsule to the internet router and there is a big improvement although not perfect but thatâ€™s where I live which is know for these challenges.The movies I watched were very clear and made me feel better about owning the TV which I regretted before.
