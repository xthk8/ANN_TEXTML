So far, this mount has been great. The only critique I have is the mounting disc that came with the unit didn't even last a week on my dash. I noticed it was pulling up and and the entire mount with phone was tipping. When the disc was removed, the outer edge of the adhesive pad looked like it pulled a layer of film off my dash and no longer was sticky. I changed the mount to be on the windshield and so far between the suction of the suction cup and its own adhesive, it's pretty solid. Time will tell if it stays that way, especially when the summer comes with 90+ degree heat. We'll see if they are truthful about the suction cup being restored under cold water if it falls off the windshield in the middle of July. Other than that, I LOVE the magnetic tab they provide to help store the cable behind the mount when not in use. It's pretty clever. If you buy this mount, just be sure to budget extra to buy the mounting disc separate should dash mounting be the route you want to go.
