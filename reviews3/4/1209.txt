This product is definitely a lot better than my previous Cell Phone Selfie Stick/Tripod.But a few days into its use, the horizontal mode - to hold the cell phone horizontally, stopped working as expected. The Screw to tighten the clamp in a horizontal position isn't doing its job properly and not tightening the clamp. As a result my cell phone is always slanting beyond the horizontal by atleast 7-10 degrees. There is a free play of about 10-15 degrees all around the horizontal position, and I always have to find a stone to place under the tripod to try and get a near-to-horizontal position.I bought this product before going on my month long vacation, and had this problem right away into my vacation. Now that I'm back, the time window to return this product for a refund is closed, and I am now stuck with this "otherwise great" product, as I cannot use it to take pictures in a horizontal position.Update: The manufacturer responded promptly and offered a full refund for the product. Totally professional and prompt. For Customer service alone, I am increasing my rating by 1 additional star.
