This is the second of these I have used having left the last one at my previous home. I was very satisfied with that one, so I bought it again for my Samsung 50" TV. It is easy to install, sturdy, with great range of motion. I deducted one star because of the somewhat confusing directions. I felt the same way with the first one but having installed this mount before I was familiar with the installation. I highly recommend!
