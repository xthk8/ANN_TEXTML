I absolutely love the form factor of this device. Purchased as a lightning deal made this an even easier choice. The magsafe Duo charger that apple sells on their website was a brilliant idea, but I don’t want to have to choose between charging my Airpods OR my watch. Thankfully this device saves me from having to decide. First of all, I appreciate the choice of colors (I can’t keep white devices or clothing clean for more than 5 minutes). Second of all, and perhaps more impressive is that this device came WITH a 30W power brick so I don’t have to run out and purchase another $40 device to make this work. Additionally, it uses USB-C so I don’t have to worry about having a lightning cable on me anymore. The form factor is brilliant, and because of the fact that it folds up: I was able to recover an entire pocket in my backpack that until now, was taken up ENTIRELY by various chargers for my stuff. Since the brick is a 30W, I don’t even have to carry a spare USB-C to charge my iPad. My only complaint is that the “tripod” phone stand mode doesnt work super well because the magnet is a bit weak to support my phone if I touch it and it falls like a house of cards. This makes it incredibly easy to have the same convenience of a wireless charging stand on my nightstand but now it goes anywhere I go. I work 48 hour shifts and now my desk AND my bunk are no longer a rats nest of cables. A small gripe that is not the fault of this particular device, but rather part of the design is that magsafe is STRONG. Sometimes when I reach over to grab my phone, the charger comes with it. Kind of a funny quirk, but may be a dealbreaker to some. If you own an apple watch, iphone, AND wireless charging earbuds: you NEED this device in your life.
