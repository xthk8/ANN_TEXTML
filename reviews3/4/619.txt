So since I updated my phone I haven't been able to use headphones and I bought these and was super excited.They are okay headphones. The sounds isn't the greatest I've heard but it could be worse. The battery life is crazy on them which is amazing. The one thing that would make these much better is if they actually would stay in my ears. I'm constantly having to adjust them and I can't even walk around my house without them falling out. Huge bummer
