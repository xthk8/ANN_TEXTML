I have since purchased a GaN charging unit, but still use this around the house. It was very useful on a trip, allowing us to charge a multiude of devices. Has 3 ports for USB-A and 1 for USB-C. So that makes it a bit outdated for newer devices. But also has 3 standard plugs, so with any charger plug, you are still getting plenty of places to connect. Charging seemed fine for speed as we usually charged overnight. A good solid unit.
