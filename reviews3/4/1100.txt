3.5-4 stars because mount is strong with good mobility and viewing angles, but for the average non-DIY'er, this will not be a happy install experience. The install is quite easy as long as you do the following: (1) replace their lag bolts with decent bolts. Their lag bolt heads are utterly garbage and strip insanely easy. View photos to see the difference between what I used (silver) vs what they provided (black). Easy purchase at Home Depot (but shouldn't be necessary). Their bolt heads are rounded and strip easy. (2) Once you replace those, be aware that the center of your TV will be ~2.5" away from the center of the mount. So if you don't have a stud that close to your desired TV centerline, then you'll have to consider a different mount or have a stud in the location corresponding to the extended measurement of the mount (I didn't measure that, sorry).In my case, my stud was on the right side of my desired TV centerline but the mount was set up so that the stud should be on the left side. I simply unbolted the center bracket and flipped it over. That did the trick. But again, if you don't know what I'm talking about in this review then don't buy this.The steel is strong, the tilt bolts hold steady for my 55" light TV, and my stud configuration worked out luckily. So I'm keeping the mount. However, if I didn't feel confident replacing their garbage bolts or have a stud in the correct location, I would be returning this.
