I've been using these for a few weeks now. When I first put them in, I was in my wife's car and the sound of the car disappeared completely. Noise cancelling is very good, and that's coming from someone who owns some quietcomfort headphones. They fit very well, and don't get dislodged while eating or daily activities, but I did have one fall out while sleeping on my side once. Now I wear a headband over the ears so I don't lose them. Sound quality is good, but I've only tested it with Pandora and YouTube. On par with some decent wired headphones, but could be a bit sharper in midtones. Bass and treble sound nice after updating the firmware. It's good for listening to music, podcasts, etc. I've gotten 6-8 hours of battery life, depending on what level of noise cancelling I use. When the battery runs low, it does announce 'low battery' but not as jarring as some others I've used. I've also not had an issue with dropped connections. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the app's choices of white noise. You have a lot to choose from, and can join up to three choices, but I was never able to find something soothing. The closest was the train setting, but you hear conversations in the background. From what I gather, you can load the sounds to the earbuds which I assume extends battery life.Good:Noise CancellingSoundBattery LifeFitpriceBad:White noise options (if you use their app)Edit: I updated the firmware after the review and set LDAC on, which greatly improved sound quality. Unfortunately, it greatly dinged battery life to about 5 hours on the first try. Because of the trade off, it's still really 4 stars.
