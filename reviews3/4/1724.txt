For context, I already own a pair of Sony XM4s, which I use the most around the house and for listening to music. However, even though they come with a travel case, I did not feel comfortable lugging them around everywhere, especially since they are so expensive. So, I was in the market for some cheap and portable earbuds I could carry anywhere and not worry about losing them.The earbuds have a fairly small case, which is nice, although the hinge is a bit cheap and might break after some use. The actual shape of the earbuds is comfortable and stays in the ear, probably even when running (although I haven't checked). There is no active noise canceling, and the sound quality is aggressively mediocre. They are suitable for watching youtube, etc., and sound better than cheap wired headphones, but I still wouldn't listen to music for extended periods with them.For my use case (mostly just listening to videos on my phone), they work pretty well, especially for the price. However, if you're looking for a "daily driver" pair of headphones that you wear all the time, I would spend some more money, especially if you listen to a lot of music. You really can hear the difference.Then again, for 17 bucks, there really is not that much to lose. I honestly couldn't care less if these break in a year anyway. They work, they're cheap, and they're small, so they fit the bill.
