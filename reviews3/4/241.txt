First off, I did notice that the attaching hook that goes inside your vent was a little wider than my vent space (2015 Odyssey), so all I did was just ever so gently separate my vents so I could slide it in between and once it's in I don't need to take it out. Though I did decide to change which event I was using and getting it out was not difficult. I wanted to test the strength of the magnets in the base, so I left my phone in my old case with the metal disk attached to the outside and I set it on the new base.Wow, talk about magnetic power... I couldn't get my phone off the stand with it attached to the outside of my case. I HAD to put my metal disk in my phone (new phone) case.In case your wondering, I'm just a regular prime member, I paid full price and get no kickback for this review. This is my honest I opinion of this product... I LOVE IT ❤️ 😍 💖
