I opened the package and put the iPhone14 Pro in and it initially didn't close. This is due to the bigger camera on the new phones sticking out. I realized later that the package came with an adapter that you can slide in that shims the gap to allow the phone to rise slightly to clear the camera, which now locks the phone in. It works! Everything is great, the controller size and feel is excellent, game play and software interface is smooth. I give 4.5/5 stars because of the fit is not perfect and my OCD in me isn't 100% satisfied that the phone doesn't lay completely flat. I would give 5 stars if they came out with a new model for the iPhone 14 Pro. I love this product, it's well made and opens up different ways to mobile game.
