I had a very good value brand that is no longer sold/supported. So, I had to go with these. The only thing I do not like is the away/separation feature does not alert until about 7 minutes. But I guess that's better than false alarms. I'll leave the house in the AM and walk our two dogs locally before going to work. I get about 7 min into walking them and I hear the ping on my phone that I have left either my keys or my wallet at home.
