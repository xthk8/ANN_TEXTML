I love these, especially for the price. I paid $14.35 in October 2022.They aren't perfect, however. In the first pair I received, the right earbud didn't work. The seller immediately sent me a new pair. Unfortunately, the right earbud in the new pair has the tiniest ring. After a few weeks, I don't notice it anymore.They are waterproof. The caveat is if you wear them in the shower, the sensors will think warm water is fingers tapping and will pause/start, adjust the volume, etc. I am getting better at keeping my ears out of the water.The call quality is terrible, unfortunately. On the other hand, the battery life is exceptional. I use them several hours a day. I put them in the charging case at night, and I charge the case about once a week.After trying all the earbud cover sizes, I found the perfect fit. They rarely fall out. I've tried the other style of earbuds with the stem and hated them. They wouldn't stay in my ears.I use them solely for audiobooks, and they are perfect for that. I've even slept with them; it's a little uncomfortable but doable.
