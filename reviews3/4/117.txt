This tripod is super convenient when filming content on my phone and taking pictures! I love that it comes with a Bluetooth remote, it makes the process so much easier. The setup for the remote and tripod is pretty straight forward, the manual breaks it down step by step for pairing the remote to your phone. Itâ€™s a great starter tripod for content creators like myself or someone who likes taking pictures. Very lightweight and compact, can throw it in your bag, purse or backpack and not worry about it taking up too much space. Definitely recommend.
