This is the smallest cover I could find on Amazon. Good thing I went with this size. It's exact! Length and height couldn't be any longer for this PC (HP Omen 17"). Took a lot of angling to get just in the right spot to not cover light or camera, so thanks for practice tape (once I understood what it was, might want to make that clearer in instructions or with a video). However, with size of application area, couldn't use tape to apply. Had to wing it and adjust once, which thankfully it cooperated with.Good adhesion so far, no issue sliding back and forth (let it set for 24 hours first like instructions said), great coverage. I have nails, but I just use my thumb or index finger to slide & no issues so far.
