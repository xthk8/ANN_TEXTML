I wanted something to put my Samsung Note 9 on to wirelessly charge at night. With the upright position, it takes very little room on my nightstand and if I wanted to use my phone as an alarm, it would be right there close by.Charging seems to work well. No hunting for just the right spot. It starts charging the moment you set it in the stand.The only reason for the 4 stars, is I've only been using it for a week. I can't judge any reliability in that short of time. But if needing to buy another wireless charging stand, I'd go right back and buy this one.
