I love these AirPods 3rd generation!! It’s way better than the apple AirPod pros which don’t fit in the ear as well and have a uncomfortable feel to them. The AirPod 3rd generation has good battery life, great quality of sound and fit well in the ears. It’s great for listening to music and for studying if in school. Super satisfied with these and would buy a second pair if I ever lost these or if they broke. Really happy with my purchase! :)
