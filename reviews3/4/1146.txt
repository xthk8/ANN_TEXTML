My Co-worker turned me on to the XCom Nano 3 charger and it’s been one of the best purchases that I’ve made in the last few months. Prior the UComX Nano, before traveling, I had to struggle to gather all the chargers I needed for my three Apple devices. Now, I just through the UComX charger in my bag and I’m all set. It also looks great at home at your desk or on your night stand. It’s well made and I don’t struggle to place my devices in just right spot for them to charge like other Chi chargers. I’m happy to recommend it.
