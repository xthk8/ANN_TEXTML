Needed to expand memory in a galaxy tablet I purchased recently, and this micro sd card works good.Install is straightforward and the extreme speed is quick enough paired with usb 2.0, I can transfer files easily between devices.256 Gb is more than enough memory if you just need to save some videos and pictures, but I did use up majority of the space with 4k recordings, resolution and file size does matter for storage.
