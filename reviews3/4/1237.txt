I really like this device. Oddly, one of its first uses was to jury-rig a small USB fan onto it when the air conditioning went out at work. I set up the little tripod on my desk, aimed the fan and I was good.Since then I have used the mount for its real purpose - mounting a phone to it and using it for pictures and video. It is handy. Small enough to throw into a backpack without taking much space. The fold-out action is quick and the clamp for the phone is easy to use.The USB remote is adequate and works most of the time. It sometimes gets temperamental, but does come in handy when you want to do selfies or remote still shots. Was a nice to have when traveling.I have used this more than I thought I would. The ability to use it as a hand-held mount, and quickly switch to a tripod is pretty neat. Great budget solution for a phone mounting system.
