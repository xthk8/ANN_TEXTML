Charges my phone as it should. I’ve only had it for a few days, but so far no problems. It does charge my phone much slower than other cords I’ve used, which hasn’t been an issue since it’s specifically used in my room to charge my phone while I’m asleep. I will mention that I have not used it with a charging block, and it’s plugged into my lamp. So, unsure if that makes a difference.
