Obviously theres very little thats perfect, but let's start with the good...SUPER easy to travel with or even toss in my purse, and the remote stays locked into place really well so I've never had to worry about losing it. Altogether super functional and height adjusts really well, my favorite tripod to date!The not so great...The phone holder thingy is a little crooked and there isn't really a way to adjust it unless you give it a full click over and then the phone is at a 30ish degree angle. It's never actually perfectly straight up and down.I was also really hoping that this tripod would be more versatile, that is to say that the phone holder clip thingy doesn't screw off. If it did I could forgive the crooked angle because I could screw on a ring light or my Canon camera.
