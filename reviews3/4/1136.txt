I bought these headphones last year and they have worked great ever since I have gotten them. Their noise cancellation is great and you can't hear anything after you switch it on. The sound quality and battery life is also really great. The only thing that I don't like is there is a notification on my phone about the headphones following me when I own them. I did figure out how to turn it off but that is the only thing that I didn't like. Other than that minor inconvenience, the headphones are amazing.
