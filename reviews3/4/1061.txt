I bought the 512gb version. While this card is reasonably fast I'm not getting the speeds the manufacturer claims on the packaging. I'm also not getting speeds some other reviewers are getting. I'm not sure what is going on. People that have posted screen shots of benchmarks have not posted them of 512 gb version so that might be a possible reason. I have tried multiple USB ports on my PC including 3.2 Gen 2 10Gbps (MSI X570 Tomahawk motherboard). I'm also using a high end 3.2 Gen 2 10Gbps card reader (ProGrade PG08). It is not my hardware. I get expected speeds on other faster SD cards I have. I bought the card from Amazon and not third party.
