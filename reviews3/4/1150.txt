I am very mixed on these. I love the battery life and the sound is actually quite good for the price. They advertise "purebass" and these have a lot of bass and it is distinct. It's a clear, almost icy bass compared to a warm beats bass. That isn't "bad" but it is different. These are great sounding headphones but if you are used to people mimicking the beats soundprofile, JBL sounds different. These are more "clear" and neutral sounding headphones but yes, this does have some nice bass. I like the sound. But I'm mixed. They are uncomfortable. It isn't so much that they clamp down tight on your head. That isn't too bad. The pads themselves are very firm and that's the problem. I don't always wear them as a result and that's a shame because these do sound very good. I am trying to wear them more, and when I do I somewhat get used to it. But these are tight headphones. I'm not at the "my ears hurt" level but the pads aren't comfortable and I have other headphones I can use. I'm really tempted to lower the rating but I also want to emphasize that the sound and the battery life is good. Let's say you feel like you are used to tight headphones? Then these are probably going to be excellent for your. If they do "break in" maybe I'll update the review. But as it stands I like the sound but I have a problem with the pads being too hard, which is a real shame. On sound alone these should be my daily cans.
