Got this to try streaming DisneyPlus and other apps like Netflix from an iPad to my Fangor (also a great product) projector. Disney Plus still blocked due to HDCP issue (which i've tried several workarounds on, but it's just a DisneyPlus restriction/issue). Other apps like Netflix streaming work perfectly, so overall still satisfied with the adapter. Apple quality is second to none, so don't expect "other" lightning adapters to work as well. Normally i just use my Fire stick to stream everything via my projector, but for circumstances with no wifi/connectivity this is my only option.
