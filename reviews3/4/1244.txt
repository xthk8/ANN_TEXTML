I bought 2 sets of these TOZO buds. I bought the "crystal" pair and these. I bought these because they have the "transparent" mode. Its not really all that amazing. When nothing is playing, you can hear stuff going on around you. As soon as you play anything, the ambient sound around you disappears. It would be better if you could adjust the level of the transparent mode.Otherwise,Yes, you can absolutely connect them through the TOZO app and set custom sounds. Some people have stated that they can't but I had no problems.Speaking of sounds, the dynamic range on these is remarkable. I'm hearing things in music that I have never before heard in music I have been listening to for 40 years.Audio has been my career for over 30 years; I have worked as a radio personality and a broadcast engineer. I have listened through many Sony, Sennheiser, Beyer, JBL, AKG and many other "professional" phones over the years.I am also the guy who builds studios and sets up the audio signal processing at radio and TV stations, so suffice it to say, I know a wrinkle or two about audio.The fit is also very comfortable. They come with what seems like 167 (12, actually) different ear gels in every size from pinhole to bullet hole to customize them to your ears.Finally... the price point. For under 40 bucks, these are a steal. I think they would be a great deal at twice the price, honestly.
