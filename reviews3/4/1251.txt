This is a great frame and brings a smile to grandmas face as she is far away from the grandkids and currently getting treatment for cancer so we don’t see her much. However, the app isn’t my favorite in comparison to other digital frames we have for family members. I would highly recommend changing the app so as you look at all of your photos, there is a check mark by the pictures that have already been uploaded. I have had to delete duplicates which is time consuming and annoying
