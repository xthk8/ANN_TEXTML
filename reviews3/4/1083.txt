Overall, I’d still buy these JUST for the noise cancellation. Had Bose headphones (AE2, QC 15, QC 35) for over 12 years. Nothing compared to QC 15. These (700’s) sound like I’m in a tin can. BUT the NC levels FAR outweigh the sound quality, sadly. Waited 4 years to buy these and honestly, I’m glad I did and just stuck it out with the QC 35’s (TERRIFIC sound quality but meh on noise cancelation—wish there was one that had it all).
