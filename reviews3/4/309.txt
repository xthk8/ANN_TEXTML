I purchased this cable in March 2022 when I needed a usb-c with the lightning plug for iPhone. Unfortunately the cable didn’t last a year. I was about to purchase another cable when I realized it has been less than a year. I am hoping for a swift resolution from the company.UPDATE for January 2023! Anker sent me a replacement cord. Here’s hoping for a better (and longer) experience!
