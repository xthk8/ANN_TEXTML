I'm happy with them so far. Amazon had them on a Black Friday sale, they arrived fast, comfort is great, they hold position without undue pressure, sound is excellent for the price.My ears are larger than will fit completely inside the cushions, but with them on my earlobes they are still comfortable. The cushions are about 56 mm vertically inside, my natural, unmodified ears are 75 mm.The noise cancellation is simply the isolation, which is fine.Bluetooth is easy to pair with my Samsung phone, and haven't dropped connection, even when I walk away from my charging phone to the other end of the house. Kudos on this.Volume controls are, mmm, interesting. With a quick press, they function as forward/reverse "play next" buttons, whether in Dub phone music app, or on YouTube. For volume, you press and hold. Timing is challenging so far. Changing songs or videos accidentally while trying for volume is common.So I just do volume on the device for now. Not a biggie.Comes with a male/male cable for wired use, and a USB/USB-C charging cable. I haven't run them anywhere near the stated 65 hours runtime, so even when using them all day, charge time is amusingly short. Efficient they are.
