Overall good frequency response, but unlike the AT2020, this has a dip in the middle frequencies. Signal processing is needed to make this sound more true to life.One definitive plus for this microphone, though, is the physical gain control. It's much easier to remove noise and start with a clean signal on this microphone than it is on the AT2020.The biggest issue is the software. Enabling Blue Voice allowed for cool effects but would often cause my output signal to vary wildly in volume. Whatever signal processing was going on there, either my computer or the software did not like it. This made the microphone a glorified paper weight. Disabling the software usually fixed the problem, but not always. At one point I did have to uninstall the Logitech software to remedy the issue.
