I’m not one who writes reviews. I find it time consuming and irrelevant when lost among the ocean of reviews put up. So the fact that I’m writing one now should be a good indicator of how impactful these earbuds were.Got them about a year ago and thought they were great, borderline perfect. Then they went into my center console when I got AirPods Pro. Recently I lost the AirPods and found these guys again so I put them back in my ears.Lets start with battery life. These buds were still alive and kicking after a year being stuck in a center console of a car. They lasted through heat waves and freezing temperatures in a car. Put them back on to charge overnight for about 6ish hours (don’t know how long they actually took to get to full) and they were ready to go again.Next, sound quality. They don’t just rival AirPod Pros in bass, they just outdo them. Sometimes the snares and highs are a little underwhelming, but if you want your ears to be shaking or want a nice audio massage, these are your go-tos. I’ll be putting a list of songs I tested below.Next, calling and general connectivity. When you are using one earbud, sometimes they won’t connect and when you first take them out, it’s about a 15-20 second start up time. With music, one earbud works fine but if you start up a call, it might disconnect. Honestly not a bother to me.Next, ear fitting. I can’t remember if they came with different sized bud shells, but I am a person who always wore AirPod Pros with the tail pointing straight horizontally because my ears are weird. These buds aren’t really an exception. Too much heavy walking or shifting will slowly wiggle them out. AirPod Pros would take the cake in that aspect but that’s it.Finally, I’ll comment on the water-resistant or water-proof claim. They are not water proof, especially if it floats away while you swim. They will get water stuck in them for a little. However, these suckers are resilient. They floated away once while I was testing them and they sound just as they did when I got them. Crisp, lovely, and very bass-oriented. The water also may be recognized as a touch so it’ll pause music. Overall? These things just keep trucking.All following songs were streamed off of Spotify with the equalizer set to Dance (higher bass).
