Overall it has a good DAC with super low noise-floor. However, it struggles to provide enough power to drive headphones confidently. What does confidently mean? It doesn't mean loud enough, which it can barely reach. Confidence here means when there's enough head-room in the power that the audio signal has a lush plush depth, solid stability, and warmth.This lack of confidence even makes it suffer when providing a signal to an amp which then has plenty of power to boost it. The insecurity of the original signal shows itself in the boosted signal.If using iPhone or similar to drive external audio, one is simply better off to get a lighting-to-usb-c and send the digital signal into something which can properly pre-amp or amp a clean signal, in my opinion.With that said it still gets 4 stars because the DAC still does a surprisingly clean and good job compared to normal 3.5mm headphone out.
