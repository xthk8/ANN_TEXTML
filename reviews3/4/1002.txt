I have been a big Bose supporter all my life and these headphones do not disappoint. I had the wired Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones for 5 years before I upgraded to the Bluetooth version (they were also great but the number of AAA batteries I went through was ridiculous). While I think the noise cancelling was slightly better on the wired version, these are still a great option for those noisy plane rides. I made the mistake of not charging all the way when I first got them, which really messed up the battery - it would die within a few hours. I called Bose and they ended up sending me a replacement for free. This time around, I fully charged them before use and I'm STILL on the same charge 4 days later. For those working from home - I also use them to take Microsoft Team's calls - the computer just switches over from music to the Teams call seamlessly. Can't recommend these more. Giving 4 stars just because the noise cancelling is not as good at the wired version.
