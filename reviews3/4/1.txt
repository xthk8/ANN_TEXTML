When I first bought this item I had some trouble with amazon's shipping department. They failed to include this dongle along with my other two packages in one box. I don't think this was the seller's fault as they didn't combine the packages. I have a dell optiplex 9020 SFF PC and it does not have a USB C port like some other models do. I got a Logitech Brio 500 Webcam for christmas and I didn't know it required the USB C port. So I ordered this to make it work. Once it came in I plugged it in the USB 3.0 port and the camera works fine. Better picture than my old one. Thank you!
