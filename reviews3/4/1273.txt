I'm not an audiophile, but I do care about sound quality, long term durability, and decent battery life.I've been using the Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones for a couple years now, and these are very good headphones, at least to me. But the case they come in is fairly bulky for my work bag. Having to put them away everyday is mildly annoying (first world problem, I know), so I was looking for something that was quick to take out/put away and wouldn't take up as much space on my bag.These ear buds are EXTREMELY lightweight. It almost doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything. The only thing I have a quip with is rubber seals that come with them. They're ok, but after an hour or so my ears begin to hurt. However thats probably a me problem and not really an issue with the ear buds. If you have clean ears, these will stay in place. If you have wax build up they will drift over time, but it's not a huge deal.The noise cancelling is extremely good. Takes out the majority of sound, lows and highs, surprisingly. I can turn on NC at work and I don't hear co workers at all. Turn off NC and I get the ambient sound as well as whatever I'm listening to.If you want ear buds that won't feel like they're intruding into your daily routine that have excellent NC and have decent sound quality, these will work. Even more so if you currently use a Galaxy phone.
