I am very disappointed with this charger. I was super excited to see it. Super excited to buy it but then I got very disappointed after I got it and start using it for just a few weeks and charge it my phone, quick and easy and everything but then not long ago, instead of charging my phone, it start draining the battery I experimented with this charger. I fully charge my phone regularly and then when it needed charging I used it all right but then I noticed instead of charging my phone start draining the battery life. All the other function the watch the Bluetooth works , because the watch all you do is connect your own charger to it so that’s not a problem and the Bluetooth is very easy and simple it charge no problem but the phone charge in section derailed the whole experience for me. Very disappointing.After my first review of this product, which is written up top, the vendor got in touch with me and they were able to re-issue me a new product which is why I am revising/reviewing this product. It is working OK I really like this product therefore I give it a four-star. The reason why I did that instead of a full five star was because my phone was a little bit hot. I’m not sure if it’s the product or maybe it’s just not compatible with my phone but overall it’s a really good product and the vendor they are very considerate, and I give them a four-star, I encourage you to try. It is very convenient and see for yourself.
