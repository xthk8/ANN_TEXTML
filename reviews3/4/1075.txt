The sturdiness could be a little better, but it did come with counter weight bags, so that’s super helpful. And because of how light it is it makes it easy to transport, which I love. So overall it’s nice.I also love how big it is, but then also love how compact it breaks down. The carrying case has multiple compartments to keep things from getting to crazy, but then they all roll and close together as one bag. This might be one of my favorite parts! With so much equipment to haul, anything to make less trips to my car or equipment area is a huge plus for me!! They did an awesome job with that design.
