I bought these to replace my apple AirPods that have gone missing. I figured they were worth a try given the good reviews and low price. For <$20 these things are great. I’d go so far as to say that even if they were >$20 they’d be very good. There’s no active noise cancellation but they passively seal out sounds well by fitting snugly. And comfortably. They sound as good as my AirPods in my opinion for music and podcasts. I haven’t used them for calls so I can’t commmment on that. All in all I’d say I’m quite pleased.
