The battery life is great and so is the sound. The touch controls are terrible. They have no consistency. From the app, I have set the left button for Ambient Sound Control and the right bud for Playback control. This works OK when streaming and playing music. When streaming video, the touch controls behave differently. The touch controls only seem to control Ambient sounds on the right bud while the left bud controls do nothing. How was this not tested?
