I like these earbuds overall but for me they have a few downsides. One is something that I read in other reviews before buying these. I had to install the Bose app on my cellphone, and when I take the earbuds out of the case and put them in, they sometimes don't connect automatically and I have to manually reconnect them (put the earbuds back in their case, restart the app, connect the earbuds). With previous earbuds I have owned this was just automatic as soon as my bluetooth on my phone recognized that the earbuds were in use. Another thing is that the fit is fine most of the time, but it's not a particularly tight fit (even though there are different size tips included and I am using the one that fits best), and especially if I have a hat on over the earbuds, they sometimes come loose. I found that the Bose SoundSport in-ear headphones I had before (which were not bluetooth but plugged into the phone) held better in my ear. The silicone part that holds the earbud in the ear is similar but there is a slight difference in the shape and material and in my case it makes a difference.
