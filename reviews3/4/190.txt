So I got to say I paid for these at a price of $49.95. At that price point the noise cancelation is the best I've heard. I'm like wait is the noise cancelation on... oh ðŸ˜‚ it is.( my mom was calling me and she wasn't happy after I didn't answer till the 5th timeðŸ˜¬) However these fall out of my ears constantly if I'm moving around. I would recommend to those of you that like to sit around a lot like myself. I would not recommend for people that like to exercise a lot or for work. I tried using these at work and they almost fell into the fryer oil.
