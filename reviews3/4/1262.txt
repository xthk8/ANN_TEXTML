This is a pretty good product. Easy to put together. But it can be wobbly if not set up just right. I’m a photographer and I wanted to try something indoor. So I bought this for my daughter 4th bday shoot. Setting up was easy. I used seamless paper which it held up nicely and no issues there. And during the shoot, we painted on the paper and no issues arose. So I’d give it 4 stars overall. It does come with sand bags if you have heavier stuff it will be holding.
