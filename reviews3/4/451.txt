I had ordered this charger 3 days ago, and man it is a great step up from lugging around my normal charger. Instead of carrying my normal cable for my XPS 13 7390 non 2 in 1 (I did not get a low power notification), I just carry this thing and a small USB C cable! I also don't need to use my old 20 W block for my iPhone, as I can just bring a lightning to USB C cable as well. It does get warm, but at this for factor you can't really complain, and it never gets too hot to the touch. I do think this is a tad expensive, but when you buy it bundled with the included cable I think it it really worth it. This will have a permanent place in my travel bag and will be used well into the future, and I will try to update if anything changes.
