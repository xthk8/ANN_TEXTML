Wish they had a longer version but this meets my needs. The one that came from Apple with my new iPad Pro is just too short. I have bought a lot of Anker cords over the years for various Apple devices. The ones I use most often are those available for an iPad. I replace the Apple cable because Apple’s are too short and fail at the insertion point with the iPad all of the time. My experience withe prior Anker cables is that they have been sturdier and more durable than those supplied by Apple and they are mi-fi certified so there are no issues with charging. But, even they fail over time and have to be replaced so don’t expect an infinite lifetime just a longer life than Apple cables and a lower price so not as big a hit to your wallet when you need to buy a new one.
