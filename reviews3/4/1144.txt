When I first received the charger I was excited to try it out before heading off on my fist road trip. I plugged in the USB charger that came with the wireless charger and set down my phone, my watch and my airpods. I checked the power levels on all of the devices and later came back to check again. What i found was my watch was charging normally but the phone actually lost 1% eventually. After the watch and Airpods where done charging the Phone charged normally. I looked at the charger that came with it and the Output listed on the charger is only 18 watts. The next day I plugged in a 30 watt charger that i had and all worked as I expected. So, if you are having the problem of one device charging at a time you probably need a higher power plug to power it. In the reviews I see some people saying they have a 20 watt charger that came with it and others are saying 30 watt. I hope hope they get this figured out because the product seems great once you get a 30w charger plugged in
