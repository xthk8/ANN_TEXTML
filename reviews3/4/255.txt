 i’ve been using this phone holder for almost a week. i know it hasn’t been that long, but i just thought i would make a review on it. i will b making an update if something happens to it.my opinion:so the main thing i’ve seen when i read the bad reviews is people complained about their phone holders breaking after 4-6 months after using them 😐 some of them said even after 2 months of using it. in my opinion, i still think that 4-6 months is still a good amount of time for use. especially if ur using it almost everyday. like dude, nothing lasts forever. but thats probably just me. but i also want to assume that the reason y it doesn’t last as long as people except it to is because people keep moving it around too much and bending it too sharply. so u just gotta make sure that ur not bending it so much and also that ur not bending it at the end where the table clamp is. idk what to call it, but it’s not the phone clamp. it’s the part that attaches to tables and counters and stuff. but yeah just make sure ur not bending that part of the gooseneck. that’s the part that i’ve seen people complain about breaking the most. i feel like it might also have to do with the weight of peoples phones. i have an iphone 7, so it’s pretty small and light. but of course, if someone had like an iphone 13, it’s bigger and more heavy so it’ll wear the gooseneck out more.pros:i really like this product so far. i’ve been using it to make timelapse drawing videos that i’ve been posting on my tiktok. and i’m thinking about using it to go live on tiktok too. another thing that i’ve seen people complain about is the fact that the gooseneck is hard to bend. and i can confirm that it is hard to bend, but i’m not complaining about it because i think that it’s a good thing that it’s like that. it just means that it’s pretty sturdy.cons:there’s only really two things i can think of at the moment that i don’t like about it. #1 is that i wish it was just a little bit longer. #2 is that it does kinda shake a bit when u bump it. but it’s not that bad. if it was longer than i would’ve given it 5 stars.this is my review for now, again i will make an update later on. 😊
