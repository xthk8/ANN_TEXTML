I'm using this with a Galaxy S20 FE and a Quadlock case. I have to remember to take the metal ring/stand off the back of the case, but then it works fine. I've had no problems at all with the phone not charging when on the stand. Once I forgot to remove my metal ring/stand from the case and the charger status light flashed, warning me I guess, that it detected metal.It is not a "fast charger" per se. I have plugged it into 30W and 65W chargers and the Galaxy phone gives a message that the charger isn't compatible with fast charging, but it continues to charge at normal speed or slightly higher. Plugged into lower wattage chargers and that message doesn't display.I gave it 3 stars for traveling because it doesn't fold. Seems like it would take up a lot of space in your suitcase.
