The mount came with all parts required for the installation. Everything was laid out well and the instructions showed various types of installs. They don't talk about height measurements, etc., but this wasn't my first mount installation, so I took my time and it came out good. The only major complaint and issue is that they make the mounting plate for the wall and TV exactly 17 inches, which will only fit a 16" wide mounting. If my studs were not in the right places so that the TV will hang even side to side, I'd be in trouble and the mount would have to be returned. So, if you need to slide the TV over an inch or two to center it on your wall, you're SOL. I haven't hung the TV yet, but that's simple. Once again, the front plate that the TV will hang on is for a 16" wide span. You can't move the TV a 1/2 inch or it will fall off the front mounting plate. If they simply would have made the mounting plates 3-4 inches wider, this would have gotten 5 stars. The exact fixed widths, limit your installation options. If your studs aren't exactly lined up so your TV is centered, you will have to install horizontal beams on the wall so the mount can be moved off the stud centerlines. I don't think most people want to see 2x4's hanging on their wall behind the TV. The price was right and the overall quality is good, but beware of the limitations.
