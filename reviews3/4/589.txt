EDIT: Updating my review because I think the issue may have been the charging cable. I have struggled with a charging issue since I bought these headphones (a few years ago) but it wasn't until recently that it just wouldn't hold a charge at all.I didn't think to try another charging cable until this week when I was testing out replacement headphones. When I tried another cable it charged and the charge lasted for several days without me plugging it back in. So I think I found a solution and I wanted to update my review to support the brand.I really struggle to find headphones that don't hurt my ears. And these headphones are the most comfortable I've found. I can usually wear them for over an hour without discomfort. So 5 stars for comfort, sound quality, and durability (I'm not proud to admit this but they have been violently hurled into a wall in a moment of rage and frustration... Yet somehow didn't break at all). I still have to remove a star because the charger cable that came with these headphones is a piece of garbage and lead to years of frustration.Original (1 star review):I have had trouble charging these headphones since the very first charge but recently it's been getting worse and worse. I've had it plugged in for at least 2 days and it just lasted about 5 minutes! They were plugged into my iPad so not even using Bluetooth. Absolutely useless!!
