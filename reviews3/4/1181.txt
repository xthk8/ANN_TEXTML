It is essential for me to use actual over the ear headphones as I wear hearing aides. I can say honestly these are not over the ears. The inside diameter of the cushion is about 1 1/2 inches. The outer diameter of the headphones sure look over the ear lol. That being said, you can judge for yourself if they will work for you. I'm sure for most people, they will be just fine! People with larger ears or who wear hearing aides, they will not be the best for you.Im keeping mine as I have small to medium ears, and with my headphones makes it usable however not the best fit for me. The quality is very good and you would be hard pressed to find a better pair at this price, so I can recommend this product! Very nice sound for anything under $100!
