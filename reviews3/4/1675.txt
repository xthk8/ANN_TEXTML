The male end of this USB Type C/female USB Type A adapter cannot reach the smartphone's USB port because the housing for the male end is too wide to go through the USB slot of a smart phone case I am using for Samsung Galaxy S21 FE model. The problem of lack fit is not caused by the adapter but it is important to consider the phone case when buying a adapter, otherwise one has to remove the phone case to use the adapter.
