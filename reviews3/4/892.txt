The mount is sturdy. The mount is capable of maneuvering for a wide range of viewing angles. It was not difficult to install.***Portions of the instructions were lacking in clarity or were difficult to follow making it hard to understand how the TV was to be placed on the mount. I had to resort to watching their fast moving video repeatedly to observe how the TV bracket properly attached to the wall mount. It would be very helpful it ELIVED improved their installation instructions.***If the stud that you bolt the mount to is not in the center of your wall, you should be aware that centering the TV is accomplished by swiveling and manuevering the two wall mount arms. The outward swiveling will result in the TV being centered but it can also cause the TV to be substantially extended from the wall (depending on how off-centered your wall stud is). After attaching my TV to the mount, centering the TV required a swivel adjustment that resulted in the TV protruding outward one foot from the wall. Some TV mount brands that are available allow you to hang the TV flat onto the wall with a one or two inch gap from the wall and that results in no ability to adjust for viewing angles. However, I enjoy the wide range of viewing angles that the ELIVED TV Wall Mount provides.***I am pleased with the product.
