This car cell phone holder worked out very well for me. It attaches to the ribs of the heat/AC ducts to the right of the steering wheel. A friend had told me that this type of device had broken the heater ribs on his car, so I was a little wary of buying this type. But I've had no problems with it. It attached relatively easily, and I think the design is a good one. It puts the phone in a great place for easy viewing while driving, and it allows for small adjustments in the up/down and right/left tilt of the phone. I have a relatively heavy case on my phone, so I was especially wary of breaking the heater ribs, but now, using it, I don't think that will happen. I'm pleased with how this device worked out and recommend it.
