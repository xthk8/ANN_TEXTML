These headphones work for me - I started going to gym at work, located in a gov secure military facility....so no blu-tooth or cel phones allowed. I needed a set of old-school wired headphones, to work with my 15yr old MP3 player ...these fit the bill, at a good price. The sound is fine, not great, but fine (for under $50 bucks). To me, they sound better than the wired, in-ear buds they replaced......They fit comfortably for a 2 hr workout. I prefer the tighter fit, for less slipping when I'm going from machine to machine, or laying on benches, etc. The big plus is that they don't constantly fall out of my ears like the earbuds did. I like the dual small or 1/4" plug option....I like the color option (blue)....I just hope the wired connection lasts (no shorting out)...so far, so good - It shipped to me overnight -- I feel I got my moneys worth -- A Black Rooster recommended buy.
