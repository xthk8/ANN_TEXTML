I bought this for my gf so she could put it in her wallet cause she always misplaces it ðŸ˜‚, the noise the it makes when you ring it to find it itâ€™s kinda weird sounds kinda android ish BUT it does the job.When you want to find your wallet you just go to the app and and beep your wallet or whatever you have it in. You can ALSO press the tile itself and itâ€™ll find your phone so it works both ways. IT DOES THE JOB!
