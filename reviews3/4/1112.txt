Rather than write a glowing review I'll give you the only two sorta complaints I have...The controls are a little less intuitive than I'd like, so I'll be taking some time to get used to them...the other complaint is the speaker side of the earhook could be longer, and my ears aren't that big. Perhaps if they put in a slider boom to adjust the length to your ear canal? It would alleviate the hard time fiddling to get the speaker actually "IN" there...Otherwise, sound quality is good, as well as volume range...battery life is less than many other earbuds...
