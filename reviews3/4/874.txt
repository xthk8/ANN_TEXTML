If you have long nails…putting this little sticky camera cover on your laptop is going to be a mission. I wish there were more than just two in the pack. The cover does it’s job, just wish there was a little groove that would help when sliding to cover and uncover the camera…again not really long nail friendly but I eventually got it. Having different color covers would be cool too🤷🏽‍♀️
