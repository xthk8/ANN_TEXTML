I read a lot of negative reviews..after ordering. I’m glad it was after tho. I have open areas on my ears from sleeping with AirPod Pros. I could only sleep with one at a time because of how much it hurt to sleep on the side I was using an AirPod on. I can’t sleep without a show on and would keep the fam up without a blue tooth headphone device. This product works much better for me than AirPods. The sound quality is definitely fine. The volume control works on the one I got. I listen to show loud enough that the voice announcing it being on/off isn’t loud enough to bother me, this was definitely a problem for other people. I have only been using for 4 nights and battery has not died while sleeping yet. I charge for several hours during the day. It seems like a good “one size fits most” fit. I have a small head and it’s a little loose but doesn’t fall off. It was only $10 when I bought it so I’m pleasantly surprised at the quality for $10.
