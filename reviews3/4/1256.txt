Product worked fine for a few months, but woke up one day and my iPhone was not charged after it had been on the stand all night. Finally figured out that unplugging and plugging it back in would “reset” whatever issue this thing was having. Unfortunately, it keeps happening and to top it off, it happens more and more frequently like every other day now. It’s too bad that Amazon has sold their soul to the Chinese and it’s junk like this that is all over their website.I also went to the manufacturers website and they offer no support services. An American product would offer at least a one year warranty but not this company.Now I must buy something else and I have found a similar product that Anker sells. Anker is a legit company who replaced an iPhone charging cable for free after I had it for 4 years because their stuff has a lifetime warranty and they honor it. Stay away from this “waitee” garbage and go with someone who will stand behind their product!UPDATE: they sent me a new “optimized” version after seeing my review. I don’t know what is optimized because it looks identical to the original. Nonetheless, we will see what happens. At least they replaced it as you shouldn’t buy stuff that won’t even last a year with normal use.
