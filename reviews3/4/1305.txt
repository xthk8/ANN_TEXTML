These headphones are one of the best that I have found in my search for my complicated needs. But not quite perfect.I used these in the factory that I work in and they do a great job cancelling noise. I could listen to music quietly and still hear everything. I didn't use it enough to comment on battery life.When I made a phone call I hear everything clearly in a work area that is loud enough that it is tough to make calls using the phone by itself but not impossible. My big complaint is that the person on the other end of the call has a tough time understanding me because of all of my ambient noise. there are people that I work with that use other headphones that work in this regard. Can anyone recommend a good option? Or, Do I have to break down and buy an apple product? I haven't read any reviews that address this one issue and it's a deal breaker. I can't keep adding to my headphone collection. I have to start returning them. These headphones are nicer than some that I have spent more money on.
