They work but the case is giant, like carry an extra cell phone in your pocket. Lacking any quality bass, just kinda of mehh.What I will say is the battery seemed to work well but I lost them before I could really test that.And out of all I have tried these stayed on my ears without ever falling to the ground although the bud did pull out of my ear but whatever. They work fine if you don't want anything impressive. All I know is there are some I bought on here for 15 dollars that sound better , the battery last longer and the case is smaller than a contact lense case. The reason I bought these and spent more money on them is because I needed some earbuds with the ear loop to keep them from falling out while working construction
