1) About Seller: The product arrived as promised, it is new packed Earbuds, Delivery from the seller was very fast, few days faster than expected and everything is in excellent condition2) About product: the product itself is very stylish, comfortable to use. Noise cancellation is incredible and Basssss oh my god, didn't expect that deep sound from such small earplugs. Bravo to the producers.But there is a default bug: you literally can not use the left plug by itself. They work fine together, and right one on it's own, but if you try to use only left one, it gets disconnected. Apparently, they know about it in the company and plan to fix is, but not yet.Also, their app is very slow and keeps disconnecting all the time.
