I bought these as I need ear buds to listen to video while working/doing stuff around the house, sound quality is what I was expecting, they connect quickly most of the time, sometimes I have to restart them to get my phone to connect. Range is decent. If you keep them in your pockets, be prepared for lint to get in the crevasses of the case all the time, doesn't do anything but look bad, but just something that if that would bother you, find a different pair with a lid. I've had similar earbuds that work better and have better battery life, but they cost 2 or 3 times as much and for my use, just wasn't worth it. A good budget Bluetooth earbud set.
