The fit and feel of these are good. The sound quality is pretty good (not tons of bass but good). The folding ear pieces mean that every time you try to put the headphones on, you have to hold, maneuver and then slide it on. Kinda annoying. I wish for straight ear pieces that don’t swivel. I use them at home TV and not travel so I’d buy a fixed one if I had it to do over again.
