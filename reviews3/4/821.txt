I love almost everything about these headphones. The battery lasts really well, the sound is amazing, and I love the color. The one thing I hate about these though are the touch sensitive controls. I'm not very familiar with controls on wireless earbuds, but all of the ones I've used had a button you could press. These ones rely on touch. I can't get it to work when I want it to, and it always messes up what I'm listening to when I accidentally touch an earbud. This aspect doesn't ruin the product for me, but it definitely requires a learning curve!
