I haven't really been a fan of Bose for many reasons, but I decided to pick up this speaker because it had a great deal. And I mainly use it for audio from podcast and YouTube videos. And it sounds excellent. It's very loud. It has a extremely warm bass sound signature. Nice, robust sound. I wish the battery life was better. And also it has some kind of quirky connectivity issue that could be just me because I have so many devices I connect. I would suspect for the majority, you would not have any connection issues. I would not pay $150 for the speaker but if you can get it for a deal I would definitely buy it.
