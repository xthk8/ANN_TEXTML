Had an old monitor given to me. It is in great shape so I decided to purchase this adapter. Works great. Cannot "split" the screen, but I can use it to "extend my screen" which works just fine for just a couple of dollars. I have bought many cables from Amazon over the years and their Amazon Basics are always the best value and great quality.
