As a giant spider living in the Forbidden Forest, natural light is not something that fills my hollow. I literally live in a giant hole in the ground. Windows are merely another way for my spiderlings to drag their ensnared meals into the house (reward still stands for whichever child FINALLY catches that Weasley). No thank you, not at all. They can keep using the back door for that, thank you very much. With living in a new "unprecedented time" every six months, I've taken to working remotely these days. This light is necessary for me to be seen in our video calls. It gets bright, can change warmth, and adds that cute, attractive little light circle reflection to my eight eyes - it gets my coworkers in such a tizzy that they shriek and vomit :::;).Giant Spider Approved!
