I love these headphones and I wish I could keep using them but i am way to rough with my headphones so they end up breaking. It's important to be gentle when plugged them in and out and not pulling on the cord all the time. I have damaged a few of them that way. I love them for the sound quality and how well they fit in the ear. They will always be one of my favorites but its probably better to just get bluetooth.
