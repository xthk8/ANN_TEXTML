if you want a big sturdy phone/camera holder that can withstand outdoor wind this is it. The bluetooth and remote were easy to set up and use. The 62" height gives it more versatility compared to the 40 or 48 tripod.As for the con: only landscape/horizontal mode, will not rotate to shoot vertically. Too big and bulky to hold as selfie-stick. I work out and have medium size hands but struggled to grasp and hold onto it as a selfie stick.
