I first bought the NC9 earbuds - which fits entirely within the ear. At first they seemed to be comfortable enough, but the longer I wore it, the greater the discomfort which grew to a point when I just couldn't wear them anymore. In my case, the units were just too big and heavy. Pros included fantastic noise cancellation which I tested on a cross-country flight. Sound quality was also very good. I especially liked that touching the left earbud cycled through the various noise cancellation modes - with each mode verbally acknowledged. But in the end, I couldn't get over the discomfort of wearing them.I then tried the NC2, which is a bit different in shape and less ear-invasive. I found that I could tolerate them better and that the sound quality wasn't much different. Unfortunately, it was harder to tell which earbud was "left" or "right" and when I did manage to lightly tap the left one, there was no verbal acknowledgment of noise cancellation mode - only a vague "beep." If you are in a noise-laden environment, you will notice the decrease in background sound, but I don't know why TOZO couldn't just simplify our lives by having the verbal acknowledgment as found in the NC9s. As with many other earbuds, finding the right sequence and timing of taps to, e.g., increase volume or move to the next track, is elusive - I would always go back to the source to make changes. The NC2s were also a little looser in the ear, meaning that it was easier to have them fall out...In the end, I liked the NC9 earbuds better for verbal acknowledgements and relative ease of knowing which was left or right, but felt that the NC2 pair were more tolerable in my ears - and thus I kept them and returned the NC9s.
