The picture quality is amazing! I used with a iPhone SE to a 64” TV. Great way to watch streaming on the big screen while using (unlimited) cell data. Only gripe is it can be a bit buggy. It sometimes takes a couple times of plugging/unplugging to get the video to display. I found it works best to let the video play for a few seconds on the phone and then plug in. Recently, it would show my phone homescreen, but when I opened a video app it just showed a black screen. I had to turn off my phone to get it to work. Despite this, I’m overall very satisfied
