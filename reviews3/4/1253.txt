Wish I could love this! It is super convenient by having all my apple products in the same spot. The only negative, is it does not charge my phone, it actually drains the battery. I put it on the mount with 47% and woke up with it on 14%. When charging the Apple Watch and AirPods it works great but when I have all three plugged in at once, my phone does not get any charge so I ultimately just use a cord for my phone. Otherwise, love the concept. The Apple Watch cord is hidden so you donâ€™t see it from the back and there is a nice led light around the edge that flashes blue when something is charging. Just wish I could use my phone with it.**UPDATE**Went ahead and gave this product another star for customer service reaching out to me and offering me either a refund or a replacement product. I opted for a replacement so hoping this one will be able to charge my phone! Otherwise great customer service!
