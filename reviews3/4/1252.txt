As someone with multiple apple products and limited outlets to charge them all this product was the perfect solution to my problem. Right off the bat, I will say that this charger is amazing I love it, working outside in a dirty environment my phone charging port tends to get a little gunged up with dust which can greatly affect the way a typical charges ability to charge it (there have been many mornings where my phone did not charge the night before) this product has greatly fixed this problem being a wireless phone charger. Not to mention I no longer have to charge my AirPods case in my work truck I can just use this charger and charge them right at home without having to charge them with my phone charger. It is not a super-fast charger but I have found that it does a perfect job charging all my products to 100 percent overnight. Plus the indicator light to let you know that your devices are charging is a very nice feature.Now this product is not perfect and does have some drawbacks that do not take away from the product being a good charger but can be a little annoying. This charger has a nice cable management system for your apple watch charger since you do have to use your only watch charger; however, the covers that go over the cable to hide it were very difficult for me to get back on after I had the cable all set in them not mention it was a little hard to plug the charger into to the provide plug the charge has built into it for the watch charger itself (I blame that on my fat fingers though). Also if you are like me and have a case on your Airpods it is very hard to plug them into the charger, I have started to just take my Airpod case out of the cover I have on it to help make it easier on me. Even with these draw backs I highly recommend this charger for anyone that wants to save space and outlets. I love it and would 100% buy this again.
