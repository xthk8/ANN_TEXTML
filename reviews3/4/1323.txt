I'd give this 5 stars if the arm was longer, but that's my only complaint! I solved that issue by using a longer one from a non charging mount I had laying around. I love that the release buttons on the sides are physical ones, not the touch kind that if you graze one accidentally whoops your phone is on the floor now. The buttons for the clamping arms don't need power from the car to work, only to do the auto clamp feature. It doesn't obstruct any of the buttons on my phone, which is the reason I returned my previous wireless charger.
