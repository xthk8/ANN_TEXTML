I tried out both and decided to keep the Bose. Here's a quick comparison:Bose Plus: better fit (Sony actually pressed against my ear inside the cup, may be just me but try it youself!), more high end look and feel, construction looks more solid (many Sony reviews with broken plastic parts), better fit for narrow head, Sony s felt a bit too loose on my head.Bose Minus: slightly more expensive, not foldable (though storage box is almost the same size as foldable Sonys and feels better protected), Bose Music app is way too basic, especially the EQ mode, shorter battery lifeOverall, the Bose worked out better for me. The new Sony M5 look more like the Bose700 (also no longer foldable) which makes you wonder the Bose 700s are more advanced. Sony M4 possibly seem more comparable with Bose 45s which are way cheaper. Haven't tried the M5 yet but also couldn't see them on sale. Frankly, I wouldn't pay full price for any of them. There are some cheap solid quality alternatives out there like JBL, Skullcandy, or Sennheiser if you just want some basic noise cancellation and good music quality. If they are.on sale below 300 go for the Boses.
