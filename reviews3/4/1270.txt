I was nervous switching from Samsung to Google, but really needed a 5G phone due to Tmobile's switch. I am pleased with this phone, especially the camera features. As far as battery life goes, it is about the same as any phone I've had and it just depends on your brightness, background apps, and what apps you use (disappointed how fast the battery drains when playing games). I like the wireless charging feature but most phone cases block it from working (can't blame Google for that). The phone does get pretty warm when playing games or while charging, but has never overheated.I was really bummed that you only get a charging cord with this phone and no block. The cord is type-C to type-C so I have to buy a special charging block instead of using one of the 100 USB blocks I have at home.
