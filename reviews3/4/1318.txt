This charger works well but because it's micro usb it can loosen over time and my new phone didn't work well with it so I now have a dust collector. But for the time I used it solid device by solid brand and honestly why I bought it in first place though probably made in a factory close to others it wasn't some ccp made one or I would think & hope Anker would treat employees better than ccp does. But also because of I had an issue they used to stand by there products. My old phone was a 8+Samsung switched to a 10+ and charged super slow tried a USB-C wireless charger and was super quick so it works but not the same. So if used for nightstand or charging overnight than maybe great choice but had same issue with one in my truck different brand but micro usb with a 2.1 charger and didn't do fast charging.
