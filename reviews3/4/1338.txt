iPhone 12 max pro. Pair’s instantaneous.Occasionally while streaming from Amazon music, the audio will “hiccup” on one, but usually both channels. It’s like the song keeps playing and for <.5 seconds I loose audio. Not crying about it, but it is slightly annoying. No reason or rhyme as to why… I’ve backed up the audio and let it play through - it works like it’s supposed to. Sometimes it doesn’t do this at all - sometimes it’s every 5th song… or 3rd song, but never twice in one particular song. 🤷🏼‍♂️Mix and match the three extra ear tips/flaps to best fit you. I’ve always had issues finding “yawn” approved earbuds. Heck, some just fall out while turning my head. The fit is so good that it acts like ear plugs and I hear my inner-tonal voice while singing to the music, or my jaw movements while chewing gum. It’s not ANC, but it’s a close second.The BASS. I’ve had subs in a trunk before. This is that - all the punch of 8’s, 10’s, and 12’s but none of the chest palpitations. Best of all, the mids and highs stay INTACT. It doesn’t bleed over or blow out because the driver can’t keep up. The more you turn up the volume - the bigger the boost. And that’s not to say you can’t hear the bass at low volume levels either. The bass is on point. From drum kicks to synths. On point.Tested -V.A.S.T. Absolutely PassedThe Tea Party - can I have a Sitar to compare IRL? And the vocals 😳🤯Pink Floyd - sounds in the background I never knew were there. And yes, definitely passed. I thought it was my heartbeat… (Breathe)Tool. PassedViscous Bass (DJ Magic Mike) PassedGoodie Mob. Passed but some of the highs were clipping. I think that has more to do with how the editing was mixed from a pre-digital era.Dr. Dre & Eminem. Both and together. PassedSnoop Dogg - percussion and precision executed flawlessly.Boston. Horns are clear and present. PassedChicago. Double what I just said about Boston and add in sounds I’ve never heard before. PassedThe Crystal Method. OMG. PassedDaft Punk. On point as it should be. Passed.Led Zeppelin. Absolutely passed. Cymbals have never sounded so good!4D sounds and soundscapes - double check. The earplug effect and the quality of the audio combined makes for a fantastic sound therapy session.The one thing I will add that I’ve noticed a LOT of feedback about: pulling the buds from the case and the case overall size. False and true.Yes, at first I found the earbuds difficult to retrieve from the case. There’s just not that much surface area above the case remaining when the earbuds are properly nestled. HOWEVER, after trying a few different ways… I have found this no longer true. Look at the picture included and know that my hand size is L-XL in most gloves.Yes, the case size is larger than most earbuds - but for the triple driver setup that fits and feels weightless in my ear while listening to the FANTASTIC sounds it’s producing…. I can’t imagine the case being the issue at all (especially the charge it holds and the charging time turnaround). Maybe… just maybe… someone will 3d print a silicone wraparound for the case that allows you to carry it on a lanyard?? For now, mine fits snugly next to my wallet (billfold) in my cargo pocket. Heck, sometimes I have to place my hand on the pocket to make sure it’s there… what’s that tell you?
