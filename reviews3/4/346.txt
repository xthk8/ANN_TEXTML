This is hard to rate, as, on the one hand, I'd like to give them 1-star for being misleading about their run time. I bought them specifically because of the boldly proclaimed "10 hours of run time!" which is... completely untrue, at least if ANC is on. More like 7ish. And what's the point if ANC isn't on? That's the selling point here.That's a big problem, and makes them unsuitable for my use, and the whole reason I bought them.But, I'm keeping them, and as far as ANC earbuds go, they're great -- and I say that with the ability to compare them to a ton of pairs piled on my desk.The main feature that's making me keep them? You can turn off the stupid touch controls! Completely! Huzzah! I know some people love them, but it must be chocolate vs. vanilla... or ice cream vs. a sharp stick in the eye, if you ask me, as touch controls are nothing but annoying to me, but to each their own. They are fully customizable, for those who like them... including "OFF", for those of us who don't! Why is that so unusual?Everything else is gravy. The app is nice, and has a variety of equalizers, including full custom. Their sound is fine, maybe even better than fine. The ANC is better than any other earbud-style I've tried.I just wish they actually lasted 10 hours. And, as with all of them, that they were smaller. But here's hoping both of those are possible in the next version... which I will definitely be buying.Thanks for reading! Happy earbud shopping! (Just keep the volume down. Trust me!)
