The mount is great and it comes with all the needed hardware for both mounting the plate to the wall and the arms to the tv. The only problem I have with it is the adjustment method for the angle. Its great that it tips forward some, especially since this is in a bedroom and will mostly be watched while laying in bed. However on with our tv the adjustment screw is 13" behind the tv. My hand doesn't fit between the wall and the tv and the only tool they send is a normal little hex key. Luckily thats not a problem for me personally as I have all the tools I could need and was able to slap together a drill hex key, an extension, and a screwdriver handle but for someone that doesn't have those things they would be hard pressed to get the adjustment wrench back there and do anything with it.
