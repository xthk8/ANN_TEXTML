I have several noise cancelling headphones & earpods. I saw discount on QC45 & decided to upgrade my current QC25. Here are my observations1. QC45 doesnt work tethered. Thats a deal breaker considering this headphones doesnt support aptx(wireless) or allows you to use a DAC for better sound quality2. My other headphones dont press my ears back(I wear glasses) QC45 for whatever reasons, causes me ear pain if I wear for more than an hour. I have used QC45 for few hours and dont know if there is any breakeven period. But QC25 is so much comfortable (comparing only Bose headphones in the review)3. I used the app & didnt find anything that blew me away. You cannot use headphones without aware or quiet modes(both sucks battery)I am disappointed that Bose headphones fell short of their competitor. Considering my hear discomfort, I have upgraded to competitor earpod with noise cancellation. I am returning QC45.Thanks Amazon for a good shopping & return experience. Sorry Bose, do better.
