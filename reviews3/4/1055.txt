These are the first nice buds I've owned. Being a female, I wanted something with decent ambient capabilities so I could feel safer wearing them while working out. These fit the bill, I can get into my music and still be aware of my immediate surroundings.The noise cancellation is good but not perfect. I can study with these in and the noise cancellation keeps the distractions out so it is good enough for my purposes. The TalkThru option works well, just double tap a bud and the music quiets itself enough to decently hear someone's voice.The sound quality is good, especially for such little speakers! I am not am audiophile so I can't give a very educated review but for unobtrusive buds, I think they do a great job letting me enjoy my music.The case is slick and does feel a little cheap. Getting the buds out of the case is awkward and I'm afraid they'll slip out of my fingers and die on the ground.My one big complaint is that the touch buttons do not work when the buds get cold. I live in a snowy climate so when I'm working outside in 20 degF I can count on having to adjust my buds with my phone. This is very annoying but I am willing to look past it as the ambient awareness is very valuable to me.All things considered, these buds offer me good quality sound but more importantly make me feel safer and that is worth a lot.
