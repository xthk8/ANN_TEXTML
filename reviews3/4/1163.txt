This speaker has excellent, almost awesome sound quality ! I purchased it to play my .wma files that I have on a little USB flash drive. If you cast your .wma file to the speaker from your computer they will play, but if you plug in a USB thumb drive it will only play MP3 format files from it.The info says at fully charged capacity it will play for 12 hours at 50% volume. I found that 50% volume was not loud enough for my use (I paint houses). I had it at about 80% and after about 4 hours I began to hear skipping in my music. It was hardly noticeable at first but the lower the battery got the worse the skipping got.Last, but not least...at least for me. The volume up and down buttons are the same buttons that you press to skip forward and back in the songs. Just depends on how long you press the button. So every time I went to turn the volume up or down I would inevitably skip to the next or previous song by accident. Very inconvenient. But, I guess if you are just going to set it down and let it go, like at a party, it is just fine.For the price this is a great little speaker ! Sounds great ! It does have pretty good battery life.
