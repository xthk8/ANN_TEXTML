Basically what I expected, maybe even a tad better to be honest. It's pretty inexpensive! it's a tad flexy, which I figured when ordering. if outside in a windy location, you won't like it as I'd guess it'll bobble around some, but inside you can just place it and it's good. You set the phone in it and it stays though! The grip is really tight and secure, which is better than I was anticipating. Has a lot better range of height than I thought it would going from just around a foot off the floor tooter 4 feet which is nice.Only thing I'd like to fix is the stops on the rotation/tilt of the head, they are a bit too far apart for my use, one has it pointing too high, then next "click" it's way too low.
