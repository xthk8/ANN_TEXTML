Have been using these headphones for months now and I've enjoyed them. They're affordable, good-quality bluetooth headphones. I love that there are no extra wires you might need because the charging cord is already attached on the bottom of the little case. I do have a small complaint though... The left earbud seems to sort of go in and out/volume decreases SOMETIMES at certain angles. Still love the fact that they're pretty good wireless earbuds at a pretty low price. I also really do like the battery life. I've spent hours with them and they don't run out.
