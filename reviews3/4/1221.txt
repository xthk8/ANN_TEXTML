Phone cradle and legs are cheesy. The telescope works great might fall over using a heavier phone/camera or even a small one if there's any kind of breeze.the remote setup was easy and great direction, the general design is great but they really could make a better phone cradle (I swapped it out with one from my tripod.). And it could use slightly longer legs for better balance. Overall really not bad for the loot
