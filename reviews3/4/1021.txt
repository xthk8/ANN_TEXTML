Bose QC 2 has the same selling point as the Bose QC 1, the noise cancellation, which is top choice, the sound quality with the app is alright although the QC 1 has the strongest bass, everybody thinks that Bose is number 1 for bass quality, that's 100 percent illusion, most of the top tier earbuds are supported by their app, and it's all based on your adjustments, to me, all the presets EQ s are weak and low volume, you have to be the engineer and custom your preferred sound because straight out of the box none of them is real impressive, however I did compare the QC 2 to the Soundcore liberty 3 pro's and the JBL tour plus they both out performed Bose in sound quality, deeper bass, loudness all around better sound, the best way to enjoy the JBL tour plus is to listen to them with ambient sound off, because they will rattle with the noise cancellation on, Bose QC 1 and 2 are still good earbuds they're just a little over priced and their over the ear headphones don't have the best bass either, The Skullcandy EVO is top choice all day everyday, they come with with a adjustable bass slider, and in movie mode they become brighter and maintain a strong bass presence with a loud volume, the only rational reason to really buy the Bose QC is really need the noise cancellation, that's it that's all, that's why they named them QC, but all the major brands have some form of noise reduction with a better sound and affordable, a lot of people say Sennheiser 3s is the best earbuds, once again another illusion, they sound good but the earbuds itself has a lot of issues that they do not know how to fix, for myself JBL and Soundcore is my go to earbuds for any occasion and their performance is top notch and they stand the test oftime, Bose is top choice in speaker's not earbuds, that's why their selling point is noise cancellation they themselves never said they have the best earbuds, people expect them to be good because of their reputation, and do to their reputation this is why they expect $300. Dollar's for some mediocre earbuds
