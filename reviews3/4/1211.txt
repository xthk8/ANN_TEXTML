Originally, when I got the tripod, it only went up to 30-40 inches. One of the extension was stuck after I gave it hard tug, it extended to full height. The tripod will serve my purposes, but it looks incredibly light. I really wish this company would make a more expensive tripod with heavier material such as metal. I am willing to pay extra for sturdiness.
