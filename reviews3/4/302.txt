I had a cable with the traditional white plastic cover. It was in a position that put a lot of pressure on the cable right behind where it plugged into the wall socket. It broke right at the bend, where it was pulled out to plug into the phone. The braided wire relaxes when it's not pulled out. I think it will last longer.
