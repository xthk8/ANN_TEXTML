This is by far the best value for a 1TB MicroSD card. I loaded mine to about 75% capacity and all went well. I am using it in a Android DAP so write performance was not a key issue for me. I can't speak to long term reliability yet but I've always had good look with Amazon Basics products so I am confident this will continue to perform as needed. There are a couple downsides to the value conscious buyer though. You do not get a lifetime warranty like other brands such as Samsung. You also do not get the write performance of the premium priced cards. With some of my other cards I get sustained write speeds of approx 70MB per second. This card will reach those speeds but only for short durations. It then slows down to approx 17MB per second. It will remain there for most of the time if writing large amounts of data. That is fairly consistent with other cards in the same price barcket for 1TB capacities. Your mileage may vary depending on content being written and your system's capabilities. Although I was hoping for better write performance, I can't complain considering this was the lowest priced 1TB card from a reputable brand/seller. Anything cheaper would likely be from an unknown Chinese brand that carries great risk of legit capacity, performance and reliability. The should be a pretty safe bet.
