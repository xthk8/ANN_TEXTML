The earbuds themselves are pretty comfortable, the gestures are reasonable, though they are preset based only, so no truely custom gestures. The sound quality with the eq disabled leaves something to be desired, but the big selling point is the bass. With eq, you can crank it, and it thumps. The case is absolute garbage though, feels empty, as if there's something fragile sitting inside of them almost, and the lid opens too easily, so a single drop would probably fling it open and send your buds flying. And right out of the box, the lid also creaks when you squeeze it. Absolute garbage. Overall, decent buds. Try to get them on discount though.
