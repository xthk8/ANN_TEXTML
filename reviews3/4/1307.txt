The price is cheap, the storage is as advertised and it works fine. My only issue is that installing it wasn't as easy as just placing it in the tablet and having the extra storage. There were some extra steps that just seemed unnecessary. Like transferring data already on the tablet in the micro sd card. Still, it works fine and I'd definitely recommend buying one if you would like extra storage space for your fire tablet
