So I've been using these headphones for the past few days, and the biggest draw for me was another user's review about it being good for piercings. I have 12 piercings on my ears, so I typically can't wear headphones, which is disappointing because I find I like headphones more than earbuds. A bit of context, I have a helix piercing on one ear, an industrial on the other, and an orbital conch I wear a ring in (same ear as industrial), and these are the ones that are typically irritated by headphones. I found these headphones are super comfy on all of my piercings for a couple hours, but my industrial and orbital conch tend to ache after a long time. The helix is fine though, which is nice. So I'd say these headphones are good for a couple hours if you have many cartilage piercings, but may start to ache a bit after a long time.For the quality, the sound is pretty good, though I do notice a bit of lag on the sound when watching videos. Not too much, but enough to notice the mouth movements sometimes are not in sync. The noise cancellation is phenomenal though, and works even if you're not listening to anything or hooked up to the bluetooth. Really cool, and helps a lot when I get overwhelmed with noise from the environment.Wish I could give this 5 stars, but I'm taking one off for the lag. Other than that, good buy for the price.
