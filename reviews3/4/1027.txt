My only previous ANC products are also Bose, but over the ear headphones. I was a little suspect about earphones but my goodness they are incredibly effective. The comfort from being able ot pick between earbud and stability band sizes is a huge gamechanger - normally I just accept that earphones will hang loosely in my ears, but these can accomplish a secure and very comfortable fit.Pros: sound is great, and you can fiddle around with the balance in the Bose app (I increase the mid and trebles from the default). Comfort as mentioned before is incredible, although I have yet to have worn them any longer than ~2 hours. Battery as far as I can tell is more than good enough for my usage (listening to music and audible books during my commute, so about ~3 hours a day).My first criticism, is the case hinge feels pretty weak. I don't remember if it started that way, or just having it in my pocket for a few days has soften the case joint, but it feels like the build quality of the case is a little shy of what you'd hope for at this price point.My second criticism is the noise canceling, when put into "Aware" mode, seems to rely on having multiple sound levels to distinguish background noise from other noise. Background chatter is only made quieter if someone is talking to me, and then gets louder when the conversation ends, which results in the background noise oscillating in volume. Also loud sounds (like a train horning its arrival) seem to screw around with it a bit.My third criticism is that the left earbud seems reasonably prone to dropping the connection. I've had it for about a month, and about 3-4 times I've needed to put both earbuds in to redo the pairing. It seems most prone to doing this if I take one earbud out to better hear the surrounding world, where when I put that earbud back in it struggles to pair it again.
