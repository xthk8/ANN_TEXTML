I got this looking for a replacement for my AirPod Pros -- I would use them for work calls and for listening. My airpods were great for comfort,, but terrible for a full day of work, and the mic quality was not great for call applications that I use.So I did some research between these headphones and other over-ear headphones like AirPod Maxes, Bose QC. I was mainly deciding between these and the AirPods since I use entirely Apple devices and went with the Sony's for price and supposedly good comfort.So here are my pros/cons after about 3 months with these:Pros:- I have a huge head and I generally have stayed away from over ear headphones for long periods of listening. These are inarguably the most comfortable headphones I have ever used. I am able to last a full 8 hour office job wearing these without too much sweat or heat, and the pressure is perfect. No headaches from wearing them all day, and it's overall been absolutely perfect. In comparison to the AirPods maxes (that I used for a day from my partner) that gave me an incredibly painful headache from the pressure after an hour of use.- Battery life / charging is amazing. 30 hours may be the industry standard but whenever I'm low, I just give it a charge for five minutes and I'm basically good for the next few hours.Cons:- I listen to a variety of music from hip hop and mostly electronic music. For songs with more emphasis on acoustics and vocals, the headphones are pretty good. However for my electronic library it leaves a bit to be desired. The bass and sometimes mids feel very muddy, and no amount of EQ I use can get it to where I like for all my music. This is where AirPods Maxes shine out. They may be 200$ more but they are inarguably better sounding with their adaptive EQ.- Not really at any fault of Sony's, but if you use Apple products you can't use the LDAC codec at all. You are missing out on a better sound quality on Apple, and can only really use LDAC with Android.
