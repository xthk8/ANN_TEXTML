I've only had these for a few days, so my review may change as time goes on.I've had a few Bose products over the years and they always tend to lean towards tight base, which is the case with these buds. If you want BOOM, look elsewhere.Bose also have a 'we know best' attitude when it comes to EQ, again, that's the case with these. There is no EQ, so if you want to adjust your sound, you'll need to do so on your source app (Spotify etc tends to have this functionality).Volume on these buds is acceptable; I think they have been designed to prevent any kind of distortion at max vol. There's an argument to say they could do with maybe 1 more notch on the volume, but I guarantee Bose have done this to prevent loss of audio quality+preserve battery. When running on a treadmill in a noisy gym, all I can hear is the music, so that's all I'm concerned about. I do find the bass to be lacking slightly below the top 2 volume settings - again, not an issue for me because that's the volume I use.The charging case is smart, well made. The pairing process was seamless. The app doesn't really do much outside of applying the latest firmware to the buds (which mine did without issue).I don't use the touch controls (I use my watch), but they seem to function as described. The auto-pause feature (when you remove them from your ears) also works well.Overall, a typical Bose product. Good audio with tight bass, well constructed buds and charging case. So why only 4 stars? I think at this price point you have to be critical. If they were $80, they would have been a 5, all day long. The volume could be a tad louder, and the app could have an EQ for customization, other than that, I like them, and I'll revisit this after a few months of use.
