This is for the DJI OSMO 6.You have to use the DJI app in order to have the tracking functionality work. The app must be side loaded on Android which is concerning. The tracking function wants to keep your head in the center of the shot. Therefore if you need your feet to be in the shot you need to move away from the camera. If other people are around the tracking will get confused and start following other people. If you move too fast it will lose tracking. The audio recording functionality of the app is terrible. I don't know what the technical term is to describe the sound issue but in a loud environment, like a roller skating rink, the loud music gets distorted. This distortion does not happen with the native Android camera app. I returned the device. The device probably works well for talking to the camera while walking around in your kitchen. Maybe future iterations of this will perform better for skaters.
