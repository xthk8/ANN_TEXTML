Currently using this earbuds as I write this review. For under $20, these are a win! I dropped one of the earbuds in a glass of water the first time I used them, dried it out in some rice and have never had an issue with them. I get several uses out of them (meaning hour long daily walks and 2-4 hours stints at work) before they need a charge. They paired to my iphone 8 with ease. The sound quality is great! The noise cancelling must be amazing because my friends and co-workers constantly tease me about not being able to hear them when I'm using the Tozo A1 Earbuds. I highly recommend these to everyone and will repurchase from this brand in the future.Just to give a complete picture, I will say, I have not really tested out phone calls using them but I think they have that capability. Also, after some time, they started saying "max volume" with every character I type. That is a bit annoying, but doesn't really bother me all that much.
