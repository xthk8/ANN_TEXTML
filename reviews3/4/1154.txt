The first one that arrived turned out to be a “lemon.” But Amazon was quick to replace it and the replacement worked great. The Yeti mic’s sound quality is really good. I use it to record podcasts. I usually record in a quiet room, so I can’t speak to how well it blocks ambient noise. One thing to be aware of: I notice a “pop” sound in the recordings when I switch on/off the built-in mute button. So, I recommend that you test that before using it in a live recording. Other than that, the mic does the job for me.
