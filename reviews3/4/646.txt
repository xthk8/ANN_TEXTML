I was looking for an alternative earbuds for casual music listening and phone calls. This product fits both demands. Battery last all day even listening music for a whole trip of 4hs or an intense day of calls. Sound quality isn't outstanding but fair enough for the price. Pairing it with a device is very simple, a quick process. It feels very comfortable, you can even forget you have them on, so I guess this is the remarkable side of this product. Phone calls sound are fine, but a noise cancellation feature would help a lot. I would recommend it as a pair of alternative earbuds.
