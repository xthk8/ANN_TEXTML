Everything about it is great except this particular item came with some rust on it. Probably sat too long in the warehouse and didn’t have paint on that spot (see photo). Doesn’t appear it will affect integrity but not ideal. It’s doing a great job for our little Samsung TV.Easy install and range of motion is very good.
