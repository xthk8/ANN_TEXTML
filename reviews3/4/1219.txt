This stand was purchased for an elderly friend that was complaining of neck pain from leaning over reading her iPad. This stand has worked out very well and my friend is very happy and no more reading discomfort. I feel the stand could use a larger range of adjustment up and down, but my friend finds it acceptable. A nice value and a solid stand.
