Works on my 16" 2021 Macbook Pro M1 just fine, even when I have a magnetic screen cover on it that fits around the notch. It doesn't interfere with the video view at all so the opening is just wide enough to be out of view while using the camera, small as it is, and doesn't interfere with closing the laptop all the way either, as far as I can tell.On my laptop model, it does cover the green LED light that indicates the camera is on or off. If ya flip the cover around to slide from the left instead of from the right, then it covers the light sensor which makes the video very dark.Aside from that minor inconvenience, I'm pretty happy with it. Much better than sticking a torn piece of a post-it note over it. ðŸ˜‚
