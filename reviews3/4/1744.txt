These were my 1st pair of ear buds and I had no idea what to shop for so I went for amount of ratings and cost and I didn't go wrong! These are the easiest pairing to Bluetooth item I've ever come across. I wasn't looking for anything fancy for high tech and these are perfect for the tech challenged. EXTREMELY easy to use. They are small ear buds and actually stay in my very small ears!! Very light weight, I can't even feel them and no need to adjust while wearing them when I run the track. I don't use them with the volume turned up very high because I want to hear other runners behind me so I can't say I bought them for noise canceling or loud music. But I am very pleased with my reasons for my purchase!!
