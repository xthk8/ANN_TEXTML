This was actually my second time purchasing these replacement blinds. I returned the first set because the blinds arrived rolled up in a small box causing the blinds to be curved on both ends. A very poor shipping decision as it would appear many others are experiencing the same issue. So I returned them and started looking at other options. In my search I found other buyers saying they had issues with the curved blinds and was able to fix them by placing them in the direct sunlight for a day. Curious to see if it works I bought the blinds again. Blinds arrived in the same box as the first time and also came out curved. Left them outside on my uncovered patio for a day and to my surprise the blinds straightened out. They were easy to install from there and we can’t tell a difference from the new ones and the old ones so I can say we are happy with the purchase. Now we do live in Phoenix and it’s close to winter here so it’s not crazy hot right now but we have a plenty of clear skies. In other parts of the country where straight sunlight is slim this time of year it may be a different story or may take longer for the blinds to straighten to out but I’d say it’s worth trying to see if the trick works for you as well.
