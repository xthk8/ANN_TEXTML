I liked the color selection of these earbuds. Thats what caught my attention along with the cheaper price point.Color-The nude color was a modern look that I liked and wanted!Size- i feel like i had a few issues with these being a little big on me. They fell out while I was standing in place getting ready. I do however feel like I have smaller ears. Shortly after I realized these come with different tips to switch out if needed for a better fit! I had no further issues after.Comfort-when they did stay in for me, i didnt have issues with the feel. They were comfortable. I could wear these easily for over an hour.Sound- I feel as if the sound quality was decent. These don’t cancel out a whole lot of background noise. However they have a nice volume range. I think I have definitely heard better sound quality on ear buds but if you don’t care about completely blocking out back ground noise, These would be for you.Bluetooth- easy to connect. Simple just like connecting any bluetooth devices.Overall, if your looking for affordable and do not care much about having all the bells and whistles. Theses are are a wonderful choice.
