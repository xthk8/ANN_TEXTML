I purchased my pair in February 2020 and they’ve held up great up until recently. Granted, I did put them through the washer twice and dropped the case a couple times. They held up great through the first wash (late last year), just minor charging issues (took longer to charge). The second wash (last month) took them out; they take 3ish hours to charge, die within 30 minutes of use, drain the case fast, then die in 10 minutes. Of course, their death is entirely my fault and I’ve no complaints about the quality after they took a tumble in the washer. Definitely worth the money, I’m buying again. They served me well and I am sad to say goodbye. :,)Design/ fit: 4/5 great. Most earbuds are a little too big and uncomfortable so I was afraid they’d fall out. After adjusting the caps, they stayed in even through workouts. They did wear out over time and began falling out once per wear around the year mark. Easy to use controls but I’d sometimes have to tap longer for the commands to register. The little tab for the charging port was hard to open, especially when in a rush; minor annoyance.Sound: 3/5 pretty good, but left earbud went quieter after a year. Sound quality not quite as good as AirPods but pretty close. Noise cancellation worked great surprisingly but declined a bit over time. Stayed at the same quality even after I washed them twice. Definitely worth the price and I would have given 4/5 if it wasn’t for the lacking sound in the left earbud.Battery: 4/5 great battery life (5-6 hrs full charge, approx whole day w/ case)Pairing: 3/5 easy to pair but occasionally won’t connect to known devices. Sometimes will connect to phone when put to charge. Annoying but not a deal breaker.
