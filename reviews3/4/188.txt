Here in my review, I'm gonna compare 3 different wireless earbuds. Airpods pro, Galaxy buds pro, and JBL tune 230Noise cancelling/ANC:Galaxy buds: 7/10Airpods: 9/10JBL 230: 8/10Touch/Button control:Galaxy buds: 5/10 (the touch control is the ENTIRE bud so whenever you touch them, it registers and does things like pause or end call. There is a "block controls" button, but it likes to automatically turn off once I get in a call and I often accidentally hang up on people because of this.)Airpods: 10/10, it's just buttonsJBL tune 230: 8/10, sometimes it accidentally registers a touch because I adjust the earbud in my ear, but it's more tolerable than Galaxy buds.Battery Life:Airpods: 6/10, just averageGalaxy Buds: 7/10, still average but seems to be better than airpods sometimesJBL Tune: not tested yetFit:Airpods pro: 9/10Galaxy Buds: 5/10, feels uncomfortable sometimesJBL tune 230: 8/10Price:Airpods: around $200Galaxy Buds: $150-$200JBL Tune 230: $100 (I got them on sale for $50)Other notes:Airpods pro: from my personal experience, they were extremely buggy and barely functioned sometimes which was really aggravating.Galaxy buds: you cannot track or find your buds once they're inside the case and closed!! They lose Bluetooth connection and can no longer be found so if you lose them, good luck!!JBL 230: same situation with Galaxy buds, you cannot find them once they're inside the case and closed!Overall:Airpods: 8/10Galaxy buds: 5/10JBL tune 230: 7/10Final verdict:While I like with airpods where you can find them no matter the situation, they are terrible. These JBL 230 earbuds are the BEST I've had yet.
