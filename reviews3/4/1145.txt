So much better than lugging around and organizing multiple chargers. I’ve had it on a few trips now, and it hasn’t had any issues. I’ll probably be getting a longer cable for it though. The one it comes with is a tad short for my tastes.I’m curious to see how the folded areas hold up after extensive use, but so far it seems durable enough.
