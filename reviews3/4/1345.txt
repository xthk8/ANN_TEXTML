I've had these for 5 months now, and still really like them. I have used these doing yard work, traveling, and at sports events with no complaints. They have multiple ear cup options to help with fitment, and even have fitment testing in the app.I also love that you can use each bud independently. You don't have to start the right ear and then the left. You can use the right one until it dies, throw it in the case to charge, and put the left one in to keep going.If I have any issues I'll update but so far I love them.UPDATE: Still love these earbuds, just wanted to add some real world. Took the fam to an indoor water park, and that is a bit much for these buds. They have to pipe in so much to counter the noise that you hear it, almost like white noise under your audio. No deal breaker for me, just thought I'd share.
