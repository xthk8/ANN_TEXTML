UPDATE: I realized this was still within the warranty period so I contacted the seller. They responded quickly and I received a new one right away.I have made several purchases of these in different lengths and overall they seem to be very durable and I have liked the quality. However, 2 of them have had the lightning connector break off in my device after a relatively short period of time. Luckily I was able to get it out myself but I’m disappointed since they had such good reviews and otherwise seem very durable. Because of this I can’t give it 5 stars and I will do more shopping around when I buy more.
