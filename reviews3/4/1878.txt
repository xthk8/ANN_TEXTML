These ear buds sound great, but I have just a couple of minor quibbles with them.First they are held into the charging case magnetically, and believe me they won't fall out.....but, it makes them very difficult to get out of the case. I usually have to slightly lick my fingers to get a good grip.On my first use, on a plane ride down to Florida I was enjoying the great sounding ear buds when suddenly the music stopped. The right ear bud had fallen out! Fortunately we were in the next to last row so we let everyone behind us exit and the flight attendant found it for me. It was on the floor in the row behind us. Now I'm a little gun shy to use them on a plane without cupping my hand over that ear. Maybe my right ear is shaped oddly, or maybe it was a freak accident. It wouldn't have been so bad if it hadn't been the first time I had used them.Thirdly, and I think this would apply to almost all brands of wireless earbuds, is they respond to taps to do various functions. Unfortunately everytime I try to seat them more firmly in my ear I raise/lower volume or skip songs, etc..I really do love the sound, wireless feature, and the charging case, but wanted to warn someone to be careful if you're in a crowded area to make sure they are seated firmly in your ears. And yes, I realize there are different sized things for the ear, but I was using the one that fit the best.Just another note, this charges with a micro USB cable, not the newer C connector, but it comes with a short cable for charging.
