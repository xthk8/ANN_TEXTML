The seller delivered my item to a different place the first time but Amazon refund me the money back & so then I decided to give the seller another chance & purchase it again because who doesnâ€™t deserve second chances lol anyways, I made sure my address was correct but then ups delivered it at the wrong house but then the person came and knocked on my door and brought it to me so moral of the story is 1.giving two chances is good 2.thereâ€™s good people out there who will bring your stuff to you 3. Never order, sign contracts or apply for new jobs ect during retrogrades Bc something will go wrong or delays will happen but than you to the seller I LOVE YOUR PRODUCT AGHHHH ðŸ’—ðŸ¥¹
