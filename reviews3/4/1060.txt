These earbuds hold up very well against even some of the higher end earbuds like AirPods and Galaxy buds, the noise pass through option works well and is handy for talking, the ANC is pretty good but doesn’t block out louder noises such as drills, generators and, saws. They block out crowds and car noises pretty well, has very good bass and nice punchy highs, only compliant is the buttons don’t allow for much customization, I would like to see a update that would allow each function to be bound to a button instead of both sides being set, they fit in my ear very comfortably and I can’t shake them out no mater how hard I shake my head, they should fit almost all ear sizes big or smallAudio- 9/10ANC- 8/10Passthough- 7/10Fit- 10/10Battery life- 10/10Case function- 7-10Durability(so far)- 9/10Touch button functionally- 8/10Overall- 9/10
