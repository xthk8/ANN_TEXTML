I donâ€™t believe in expensive wireless headphones as they can be lost easily. These work well. The battery life is good, last me the day. Sound quality in nice and the battery charging case is convenient plus it has a USB C charging port which is great. All in all. For the price of $14 they are worth it and make a decent pair of wireless heads.
