I ordered this product August of 2022. It was working great! Loved it. It was easy to use and all I needed to do what just lay my phone on top to charge. It even worked with a thick case. Now I wake up 2/6/23 and my phone it’s half battery. So I took it out of the case to see if they may be the issue? Unplugged the unit and replugged it. Still it won’t charge my phone but it did charge my watch. So now I’m going to have to buy a new one or charge my iPhone the old fashion way.
