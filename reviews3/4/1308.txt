I like the fact that this wire comes with handy little clips to secure it. As advised in the instructions, I tested the wire before unrolling and running it through the house, and it did work, although I did not do a speed test. The next part was my own fault: I needed to connect a wire to a wall-plate, which I've done successfully with other ethernet cable before, so I cut the clip off at one end. That's when I realized that the actual wires inside the cable are not much thicker than a human hair. I was unable to make them connect with the wall plate - too thin to work with. Don't do what I did, and the cable will should work for you.
