I really enjoy this product. The set up of the mic was very simple and easy. The sound quality is in decent condition. I wasn't expecting it to be in high definition quality, but it was definitely better than expected. Listening back to the feedback on the mic, the noise cancellation was very good as well. I almost couldn't hear any background noises. I put a test to see if you could hear the background, and I could still hear the noise, but it was very faint. Overall I think this product is definitely worth its current price.
