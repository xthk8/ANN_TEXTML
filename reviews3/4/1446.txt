I guess my vents aren’t high enough so when using the GPS, there are parts of my screen that I can’t see because they are blocked by my steering wheel. Maybe I will go and find one that goes on the dashboard, but also has a bottom to prevent the phone from slipping.I find that the dashboard phone holders make it easier to maneuver your phone safely while driving (if necessary). For example, if you need to quickly change your route. With this one, I can never see the time I have left in my drive, the time I’ll arrive at my destination, and the miles I have left because it is blocked by the steering wheel. I have to go out of my way to duck and see it, which is not safe. I want to be able to glance quickly and see it. This is only important to me because I frequently drive like 2+ hrs from school to home, or from Boston to New York ETC.However, this is at no fault of the product itself!
