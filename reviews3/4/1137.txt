The noise cancellation feature is very cool, and for people that are looking for that as a main feature in their earbuds, I think they’ll be thrilled.For me, I was more interested in the sound quality and battery life, and was a little disappointed. It is by no means bad, but it also isn’t anything world shattering.I went from normal AirPods to Pros and was expecting a much more significant jump in quality. There is a noticeable jump, but it is far from the leap I was looking for. The Pros sound better, but I still find myself using my regular AirPods often because I prefer the fit of those over the larger silicon tips of the Pros. Battery life is also higher, but again, it’s more of a mild improvement than a generational leap.They’re very solid, but not a must buy. I think for most people, the choice between AirPods and Airpod Pros will end up being personal taste, and which features and fit they prefer.
