I like the price and the famous name. The sound, I thought was great. The ear muffs begin to irritate after a few hours. I don't even need to charge them very often. My wife got "Over-the-ear" headphones and they were even cheaper had more features and sounded so much better, the bass on hers blew these away. I could wear over-the-ear type for much longer but these were the first I ever owned. Tried earbuds several different kinds and I sweat pretty bad when I train and they all would just fall out. I'm going to upgrade to over the ear and with more control of the sound, perhaps a type that has an app to help set the sound.
