I don't know if I would say it's a "fast" charger. Works like a normal car charger and it for sure doesn't charge faster then any other car charger I've had. That being said it works and it's awesome and u really can't beat the price for anything like it. There might be better chargers out there as far as speed of charging but this one is worth the money I would buy it again
