I tried a different, more padded sleeping mask/sleeping headphone combo that I thought would help block out noise… but that just ended up being stiff. It was heavily padded everywhere except the spot I’d needed: my ears. From that, I’d decided that the sound canceling just wasn’t going to happen with comfy headphones, unless I wanted to spend a lot of money.My arsenal against heavy snoring now includes these headphones, clay ear plugs (though I’d recommend wax instead), and a separate sleep mask. With the headphones turned up all the way, I can still hear my sleep meditation through the ear plugs. I still hear the snoring a little, but I’m able to sleep. And I can still hear my alarm in the morning. Sleeping on my side is fine — not great, but fine. The biggest struggle is to make sure I don’t have too much clay in for my ear plugs, or they get pushed too far in by the disk-like headphone speakers (which are maybe the size of a quarter each and a quarter inch thick).The sound quality is fine, the comfortability is fine, and the amount of time they last on a charge is fine (best to charge every day if you use every night). If you’re looking for THE perfect, completely comfy solution for side sleeping with headphones and cancelling sound… good luck. This is an okay solution for an annoying problem. It’s not perfect, but it works. The quality of this product is high for the price, and good for my needs. The controls don’t work for my meditation app, but I assume that’s just from the app coding and not the headphones themselves.My headphones did not come with a charging cord. That’s my reason for four stars instead of five. I would still highly recommend!
