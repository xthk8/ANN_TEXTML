The magnet is strong it sticks to the refrigerator so well I could barely get it off.But the phone case has more plastic in the way so it doesn’t hold well at all for my particular case which is a UAG style for the pro max 14.That’s a case dependent thing. My wife has another style of this for her phone and it works great. So overall a great product just take a look at what type of case you have beforehand.
