I am not really blown away by these. Ive had tovo in the past which has a battery life of almost all day before needing to charge in the case. They were cheaper and better sounding in my opinion.My jbl headphones do feel much better than my last set. They look good in your ear, if you can see them. Instead of having a big ball coming out of your ear. I can lay down with them as well which is a big plus.The charging case could use some work. It only has one light when I have been groomed with 4-5 lights on the other brand, to show battery life. The jbl case is hard to guess what it means. I just try to regularly keep it charged. Especially when the headphones are in use.battery life is pretty poor. I enjoy using headphones for hours on end and these seem to only have 3-4 hours of life before they need to charge in the case.Volume is decent. But could be more. Bass really isnt there. I know these are not my SkullCandy SkullCrushers, but the majority of my playlists are songs that NEED bass to complete the song. I honestly prefer my 2006 Tahoe with a stock bose stereo over my JBL headphones.The case is hard to remove the headphones. I cannot grab them properly sometimes. I have small hands for a man so I would think its impossible for a person with big hands/fingers to extract the earbuds.No revision for a keychain or hook. I ended up finding a silicone case with carabiner for $10 also on amazon. It dramatically upgraded the case in my opinion. It also seals the charger port so pocket lint cannot get in. Easily flap it open when you need to charge.At the end of the day, yes I still use these daily and for hours on end. But would I buy them again? Absolutely not. These will most likely get replaced in the next couple of months when I get tired of them.
