I got these for a back up to my AirPods Pro 2. I wanted to try something else that did not have the price of the Apple but still have native connectivity.I like that packaging of the units but they were smaller than I thought. I have bigger fingers and they are hard to put back in the box. You also cannot charge these wirelessly they have to be plugged in.The sound is great and the noise cancelling is better IMHO than the Apple product. They block out more noise and I don't hear my neighbors when walking the dog so that is a huge plus.Like the color scheme not great for all but for me it worked. Using them this week for work travel so will be interesting to see if I lose one or both.
