I have been using these earbuds for almost a month now and I can say that these earbuds sound great, the noise canceling is superb. However the product itself can be buggy sometimes, for example, you can only use the right earbud on its own dispite others saying you can use them independently. The only way I can use the left earbud is by opening the case so the right earbud can connect to the left and pair with my phone, this can be very annoying sometimes and it can be very finicky. Other than the software problem I can say that these earbuds are great I just wished bose dident use us as beta testers. If your looking for comfortable great sounding noise canceling earbuds these are a good choice but just know that there are downsides like the software problems and lack of features like wireless charging case.
