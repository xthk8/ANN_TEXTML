Short reviewBluetooth range: shortBattery life: goodSound quality: goodProblems/bugs: some times will randomly disconnect and reconnect.Worth the price? Yes, if on sale.Longer reviewI got it during the electronic sale during Christmas.I work for Amazon as a driver so having some earbuds to listen to music as I work is great.After you pair the ear buds to your device it will remember it and automatically connect to it when you take them out the container if your Bluetooth is on.I noticed that the range is not the best can't leave my phone in the van and run up to the door music will start to skip or stop.Only con for me is that it will randomly disconnect and reconnect to my phone even if I'm close to it or have it on me. This does not happen often but still somewhat annoying when it does happen.Overall I like them and will use them till they stop working or I lose them.
