The sound quality on these are hands down the best out of all the ANC buds I have tried. They sound is a lot more fuller, clear, bright and dynamic compared to the Airpod Pro 2. It is like night and day listening to these compared to the Airpods. The design is also very nice looking in your ear and much much smaller profile compared to the 1st gen QC Buds.That said, no wireless charging and the case is slippery and easy to drop out of your hands. In addition, the ear buds have this super magnet attachment to the case which makes it quite difficult to get them out of the case. If you can overlook these negatives and going for best sound quality, these are THE BEST...hands down.
