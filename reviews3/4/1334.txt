Product seems strong and loves and feels like it will last. I only gave four stars instead of five because I have no way of knowing yet whether it will last. I also keep getting an email that is obviously a scam. It says itâ€™s coming from the company and to click the link because there is a problem with my orderArrived quite a while ago. I have not clicked the link but I received the email more than once. It gives plus for concern
