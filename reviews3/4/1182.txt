I like that this product is inexpensive and functional. I've purchased other high-priced headphones, that needless to say, are no longer working. Because of this, I decided that I wouldn't purchase high-priced headphones again. When I saw these on Amazon, I decided to give them a try. They are about a quarter of the price of other headphones I've had in the past. They work fine for everyday use.
