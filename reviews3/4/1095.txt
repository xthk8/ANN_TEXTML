When I first got these I was in LOVE. They worked great and I was impressed with the sound quality for the price of them. It’s also been hard to find ear buds that fit my ears. I’ve been a JBL fan for a while and have many of their products. We’re a few months in now since this purchase and I’m now regretting it. For some reason the left headphone dies while the right is fine. I’ve had to unpair and repair the headphones multiple times during a workout. If they’re not fully charged, the sound goes in and out. It also goes in and out if i don’t have my phone RIGHT next to me, even if it’s on the floor right in front of me. I wish I could return these, but unfortunately the time frame has passed. I also feel frustrated as I RAVED about these headphones for the first few months and many of my friends have purchased them because of that.
