UPDATE 2/8/2023: Didn't work at first on one power strip straight into USB, but did work on another. Also tried with a power brick and that worked on the original strip. So, if you have issues try a couple of different plugs.---------These don't work with my Samsung A23. Tried 2 in a power strip that another device is plugged into and working. Phone says replace cable but they are brand new.
