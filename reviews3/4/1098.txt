These things work great for their price, fit comfortably in my ears, and the battery life is an all day thing. However, one thing I didn’t pay any attention to and wish I did- the charging case they come in doesn’t have a lid or closure. I have no idea why they would design it like that.. all it does is collect dust. I carry these around in my pocket or purse to use at work and whatnot, and they inevitably collect debris that I have to blow out every time I use them. I’ve used a q-tip and an electronics air duster canister on them already and I’ve only owned them for a month.
