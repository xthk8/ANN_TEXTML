I bought these to use at my job, and was hoping to have great sound quality but still have the option to hear my surroundings when need be.. well these do exactly that, or you can choose to have noise cancellation by exceeding a certain volume. They hold a charge fairly decent, though I think the charging box battery should last longer itself to recharge them. But honestly itâ€™s still excellent battery life, especially given how affordable these particular earbuds are. Overall, these have great quality sound, Easy to use tap controls, hold a charge far beyond my work shift, and are super cute and pretty comfortable. I would list these earbuds a #4 on my top 10 favorite Amazon purchases of all time, and I would highly recommend you trying them yourself. I have already Told multiple friends of mine about these, so trust it is well work it!
