I’ll start with how amazing the sound quality is out of these earbuds, best wireless earbud sound quality I’ve heard, I compared to AirPods gen 1. AirPods Pro gen 1 and 2. But for $300 when comparing to AirPods Pro 2, AirPods takes it. I wear earbuds all day for 4-6 hours at a time, I’m a automotive technician so I would use the noise cancellation features quite a bit. I do love that the noise cancellation is adjustable, and both the AirPods Pro 2 and Bose quitecomfort 2 have a adaptive transparency mode that allows all noise in but protects from noises above 90 decibels, which in the automotive industry is pretty much every air tool we use. When Bose activates this feature it sounds robotic and changes your listening audio, makes it sound odd for a second or two, apple is much smoother when their adaptive transparency works. Also many more features with the apple earbuds, from 3 charging methods and find my features, Bose only has one which is cable charging. AirPods can completely turn off transparency or noise cancellation, Bose cannot. My biggest reason for ultimately choosing AirPods pro2 was the comfort, the Bose earbuds began to chaff my ears after about 1.5 hours, the AirPods I can go for 5+ before I notice any discomfort. So side by side with features the apple AirPods will win this hands down, but… if you’re an audiophile, the sound quality you get from Bose is unbeatable and apple doesn’t come close, also the adjustability of degree of noise cancellation is a fantastic Bose feature, but other than that, the AirPods won me out, mainly due to their integration into iOS UI. I’m sure if I had a android I would stick with the Bose option but apple made sure the AirPods work flawlessly with their iOS devices. Last thing I will mention, maybe it was just my set, but they were a bit buggy. What happened was, in 5 days of owning, they connected 6 times but played no audio, I had to set them back in their case and start over for that to remedy, also for the first 15 seconds after you put them in, the tap controls are very buggy, either severely delayed response or nos response, once they’ve been in Your ears for over a minute they work perfect. Last annoyance was using tap controls, when using it’s almost like an even slight tap on the earbuds is amplified and is obnoxiously loud, I thought maybe I was tapping too hard, but with AirPods gen 1, which are all tap controlled, the action of tapping on the side produces no real noise. I’m telling you, the tap on the side sounds like a balloon popping at a distance of 15-20 ft away every time, it was very difficult to overlook that during my use. You literally have to delicately tap the side to have no audio discomfort, with AirPods I will literally tap with my buckles if my hands are dirty and I get no audible discomfort, no shockingly loud tap, so I don’t know if it is physically transferring the noise in or the noise transparency is interpreting the tapping as a noise and just amplifying this for your ears, either way it’s highly annoying and was the ultimate deal breaker for me.
