I haven't had these for a full week yet but so far they've been really great! I bought them specifically so I could listen to calming audios at night as I fall asleep. I was getting annoyed with having to choose between using my earbuds or charging my iPhone as they share the same port (which doesn't seem very smart for a smartphone to me ðŸ™„) so I decided to check out Bluetooth earbuds. I looked at several but these seem to have the best reviews, especially for the price. So far I love them for what I use them for. They're great for wearing at night while I'm lying in bed. When my audio is over, I usually wake up because of the lack of sound but these earbuds are so easy to snap into their case magnetically that I haven't had an issue with putting them up half asleep. My only complaint so far is that I've used them while getting ready for bed and they have a hard time staying in while I'm doing more than just sitting or standing. Washing my face seemed to move muscles that pushed them out. I couldn't imagine them being secure while working out or taking a shower, even though they claim they're waterproof. If you're going to buy them to use for workouts, definitely try them at home first with some warm-up movements to see how well they stay in for you, just so you don't accidentally lose one first thing. But to use at home for audios, or podcasts, or audio books? I think they'd be perfect for all of those.
