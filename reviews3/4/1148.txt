I love how the charger fits and my purse! I never wear my watch because it dies quickly. Now I can change it anytime, anywhere. I do wish the charging cable and port was smaller and more convenient. It's so bulky and the whole point was to be slender and save space. I also wish the charger cable could easily attach to the charging kit. Other than that it changes well and doesn't over heat my devices!
