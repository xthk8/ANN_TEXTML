I bought these headphones primarily for watching TV late at night so I don't wake the better half., though I would use them for music as well. Out of the box, they sounded pretty good...a little bassy for me, but not over-the-top. So I downloaded the app, with which you are supposed to be able to adjust the sound, or in my case, turn the bass down a little. That's awesome in theory, but I never could get these things to pair with my Pixel 7 either for the app to work, or the headphones themselves to work with the phone at all. It would not recognize the Q30s. I had no problem pairing with my Nvidia Shield Pro or my Firecube, but they just would not work with the phone.So I attempted to troubleshoot online. No help there...just the usual pairing instructions, and advice to contact tech support if they wouldn't pair. This is where the aggravation really set in. In order to access any tech support whatsoever, you have to fill out a form very similar to what you would if you were RMA'ing or filing a warranty claim. They want EVERYTHING...serial numbers, proof of purchase, etc...for a simple tech support question! I'm surprised they didn't want a blood sample or fingerprint. Ridiculous. Then, to make matters worse, after providing them with everything they asked for, I got ZERO response. It's been 4 days, and nothing. With that, I'm out. These are going back today.So if they work for you right out of the box, you should be good. I did not test noise cancellation or any other feature, so I cannot comment on that. One thing I can say is that the wifi range is very good. But their complete and total lack of customer service makes me recommend that you stay far away from Anker. Apparently once they have sold the headphones, they are done with you...and couldn't care less about you.update- now 2 weeks from asking for support, and STILL no response. Pathetic.
