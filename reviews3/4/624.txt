I'm no audiophile. I purchased these on a whim because I thought I lost my Tozo buds. These work well. I have smaller ears and they fit comfortably without fear of falling out. I use these primarily for talking on the phone for work and for listening to audiobooks. They are pleasantly more bass-y than the Tozo ones, but for phone-talking purposes, I would still prefer the Tozo. For some reason, even the max volume on these for phone conversations feels pretty low. I'm always automatically checking to see if I can adjust it louder (no these buds don't have their own volume control). That said, these would be great for listening to music. No regrets in purchasing these though - certainly not for the price!_____Update 12/1/2022:The volume issue has been resolved! I changed nothing with ear placement, so I'm not sure what happened - software update on my phone or what, but I can now hear people well while talking to them on the phone using these buds.I'm still keeping it at 4 stars because I have noticed that with prolonged use, they don't sit as comfortably in my ear. My ears start hurting after an hour, and some days, even before that.Still, a fantastic value for non-audiophiles who still appreciate a decent, full sound.
