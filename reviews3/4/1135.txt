so when I bought these , I knew what i wanted specificallyand that was AirPods pros but I wanted it to be as cheap as possible this was the one I found And I was kinda scared to buy it because everybody had something to say about the product and I order January 26 and it came on the 31'st when I got it the box was a little beat up but when I opened up my AirPods it looked brand new then I tried to pair them to my phone but it came up as" grandma " so I paired them to my phone then went to my settings and change the name of the pods then I paired it to my tracker and it was as if it was brand new the noise cancellation is great and they didn't have no problems and FYI I got the excellent condition...!!!
