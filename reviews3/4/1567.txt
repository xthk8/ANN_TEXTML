These earbuds are really nice and I really like the red color but every time I take out my earbud and then put it back in there’s a static and then I have to disconnect and reconnect the earbud to my device which is very time consuming. They also aren’t very secure in the future if I were to get some I would get ones that curve around my ear because these ones have to be adjusted frequently. The sound quality is really good in them but considering the white noise I experience whenever I have to take them out and put them back in as well as the problems with them staying in my ear regardless of me changing the size of the earbud, I don’t think I would recommend these. I think it’s worth the extra money to invest in one that’s going to stay on your ear. My husband got the more expensive version of these is that curve around the ear and they are 1000 times better and the sound quality is absolutely incredible compared to these ones.
