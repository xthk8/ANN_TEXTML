I miss my 1/8" jack. These things break constantly, and there is no way to charge your phone and listen to music through wired headphones. When the product is new, it performs fine, which is why I keep buying them, but I go through probably 3 a year even when I reinforce them with shrink tubing and pen springs. I never had issues with headphone jacks that were built into the phones, and contrary to the propaganda that what cooked up upon the removal of the headphone jacks, they are still the preferred audio transfer method for the vast majority of usecases. They are not an archaic technology. They just make less money than Apple's proprietary connector.
