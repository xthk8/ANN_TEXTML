It's a boring old Android phone directly from Google. It will do a great job... for just a few years, which is exactly why I am here. See, my old Pixel phone was just fine but no longer received software updates. All the new Android 13 stuff is was out of reach unless you pay to play. Software wise Android has gotten quite good and worth the upgrade for the OS. I largely use iOS devices because I can keep them pretty much until their end of life, well beyond any Android.As for the Pixel 7, it's snappy, a little large for my liking. Well build, but so much glass I will likely destroy. The front metal lip where it meets the glass is quite uncomfortable - not very ergonomic, digs into the hand, a little scratchy even. The massive camera bump isn't my favorite in-pocket experience either. Kinda hate the industrial design to be honest. But again, for me, it's all about Android OS 13.
