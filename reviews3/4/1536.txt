From the moment I got the adapter, the connection would occasionally break off. This happens both when I move around and when the phone and cable are not moving. However, this did not get any worse over the 6 moths when I was using it for multiple hours daily. This is a common issue that I saw across reviews for this product by other brands too, so it might be more of an issue from the phone's female plug.The cable, as with most Apple cables is not the best and gets a little dirty, but hasn't been much of an issue.
