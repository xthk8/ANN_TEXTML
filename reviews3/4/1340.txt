First of all, the sound quality IS excellent. Perfect go-to at home if you’re looking to listen to music. I was expecting active noise cancellation (based on something I originally read), but that’s non-existent. I think they’re keying in on having a really, really, good earpiece design. Lol. They’re NOT the AirPod Pros in that regard. (Note: I didn’t bring these on a recent flight.) Also they claim battery life in excess of what I’ve experienced. Not as long, BUT pretty good. The other goofy part? Like many of their competitors…like great but hard to dig out of the charging case, and the male end of the wire inserted into it is old school (but they do provide one, to their credit). And finally, all in all the price of these is all over the map (I think I paid $79…I’ve seen them as low as $69…and up to $169…what’s the deal with that?) At $79 they’re a great acquisition, but what are we buying earbuds or a penny stock?
