I bought this as a gift for my coworker. Overall, she was pleased with the gift, but I didn't like the fact that it was mailed out to me without a box. It just came in a plastic bag with no picture of what it is, no instructions on how to put together. I had to print a picture off amazon to include in the gift box that I personally made for this item. Other than that, the stand it nice and sturdy and serves its purpose.
