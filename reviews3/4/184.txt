These headphones are definitely not meant for everyone. Their main selling feature is the bass slider, which at max bass is just complete overkill. It feels like a head massage. It's awesome. At lower levels the bass is actually really good, and much more suited for actual listening.Everything else about the headset is pretty much average for the price point.The mic is fine. If you're just taking a call from a family member or friend, they'll be able to understand you clearly enough. If you're going to go into a professional setting I would definitely recommend using a different mic.The sound quality is good, but if you're a stickler for that kind of thing you're probably better off looking at something from sony, sennheiser or audio technica; you'll get much better sound quality at a similar price point. The sound profile is actually pretty solid, but it obviously has a huge spike in the base. Sound stage also isn't too impressive.The build quality leaves some to be desired, but I wouldn't describe it as cheap or poor. The buttons are a bit too clicky, and the slider is a bit scratchy. Most of the casing is plastic, but it's not cheap plastic, and the inner headband has some metal in it. The padding on the ears is nice, but the headband could use a little more. On the top of the headband is some felt like material, which is a really bad choice. It gets a ton of hair stuck on it and looks kind of bad.These are not the ANC model. Background noise is pretty noticeable in loud areas like a plane or bus. If that's something you're concerned about, avoid these. The bass is also going to be very noticeable to people around you if turned up. I wouldn't recommend these to someone who commutes a lot, they're much more suited for either home use or gym goers.
