I spend most of my day with one earbud in, listening to podcasts and audiobooks, so I'm not much help on the sound quality for music. But my son, who DOES love music, also loves these earbuds. He says the base is incredible for such small and inexpensive earbuds.The build quality is solid and the magnets do a good job (almost too good) of holding the buds in the case. There is a satisfying "snap" when you open and close the case.The semi in-ear style is great when I need a break from the kind that fully plug your ear. I need to be able to hear what's going on around me so the lack of total sound isolation is a plus for me.My only quibble is that the battery life isn't as long as my A1s, but given that I usually only have one earbud in at a time, that's not a problem.Overall, I'm a big fan of yet another affordable yet quality earbud from Tozo. It's a relief to be able to give them to my kids because the sound quality is up to their standards, but it's not going to be a tragedy if they lose them (which has happened, more than once!)
