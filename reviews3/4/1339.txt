I own a pair of Sony XM4 and Sennheiser CX400 earbuds and I can say these definitely have a unique sound compared to both of them, almost as if it has extra dimension to it so as far as sound goes these are really something else and worth the price if you just want music without the frills and features. Only downside is there is no way I know of to change around EQ and the bass can be a little bit too much sometimes.The fit is nice and cancels out background noise well enough but I changed out the eartips for Spinfit CP360s because I wasn’t a huge fan of the included ones. The navigation buttons aren’t as convenient as some others but I prefer the physical buttons just for the fact that I won’t accidentally press them while working. Even with the somewhat odd shape however I can still wear them all day without being bothered too much.
