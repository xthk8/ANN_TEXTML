Read the answers to the questions that have already been asked to save yourself some of the heartache I ended up with.The base is not clear, itâ€™s milky white.The top part is not sheer at all. It is shiny and iridescent which is expected.Most disappointing is that it says in the description it will fit any popsocket mount, which turned out to be false. I have the car mount and it does not fit. Only completely flat popsockets will fit, which is what I thought and found it strange when I saw that in the description. I thought maybe there is something I donâ€™t know? But no, it just doesnâ€™t work. Now I have to get a different car mount. Annoying.And lastly, despite it saying so in the description, the top part does not come off so no MagSafe charging ðŸ™„If none of that bothers you, then you will like it. It is nice and pretty.
