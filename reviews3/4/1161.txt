This little speaker is perfect!! I needed to replace my old one. I do a lot of camping & there's no cell service. So, I needed a small speaker that had a USB for MP3. Haven't made it to the mountains yet, but I did test it. The battery life is amazing! I had it running on Med - High for 10 hours & it was still going strong. I could hear it throughout the house. I would have given 5 stars if it had an actual skip button. I've found myself skipping a song instead of turning the volume up. Other than that, I love it!!!
