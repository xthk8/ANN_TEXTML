I bought this for a cruise! I love that you can charge your watch, phone, and headphones all at once. It's fits perfectly in a backpack, purse, fanny pack, beach bag, anything you need it to! Folds up nicely. It charges the items well. Not great for a cruise as there can be sliding but great for other travel needs.
