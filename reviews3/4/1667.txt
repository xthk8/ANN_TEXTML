I needed two of these adaptors for my MacBook Air M2, so I wouldn't need a hub to use two of my devices simultaneously. No can do. They are too wide to use at the same time. No reason to buy more than one of these. This is an Apple screw up! They should not have made the ports so close together. Why wouldn't they have know this?
