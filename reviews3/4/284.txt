Got this product for my work computer, as I do a great deal of virtual appointments and meetings (like most of us these days). I like the clip and swivel piece, so I can easily move the light around as needed. Appreciate that it has both a warm and cool setting, and brightness levels within each, as well. It was very easy to understand and use. It's a little smaller than I was expecting, I think, but overall, good product. Does what it says it will do for a very reasonable price.
