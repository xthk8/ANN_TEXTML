I bought these for my husband to listen to the TV at night in bed. Thus, I do not have to hear the TV. First the pros, they seem well made, I like the case, they charge fast, they connect quickly via Bluetooth to the TV, the sound comes through loud and clear, the battery lasts all night. Now for the cons, the different ear pieces don’t seem to be shaped for a good fit in the ear —- they are more round and need to be narrower, (my husband uses the smallest size and his ears are normal size for a man, the next size up was too big), the volume control is either loud or mute—doesn’t seem to adjust easily and the direction on how to do the volume adjustment are not very clear or do not seem to work very well. I want to adjust the volume on the ear piece and not have to down load an app to do it. Overall, for the price, I did expect more but my husband does like them. I bought a cheap pair of another JBL model for myself and I actually like mine better. But, I only listen to ebooks and movies on an iPad with mine.
