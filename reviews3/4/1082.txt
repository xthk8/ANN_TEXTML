Got these in the mail today, so I haven’t used them long term, but I can tell what I think so far. I love the packaging. It was sleek and easy to open. No fuss. I also loved how easy the headphones were to set up and start using. They look great. Love the color and they look good on. They’re comfortable. But a big flaw with these is that they fall off fairly easily if you look down. I do have a small head, but my husband tried them on and they did it with him as well. I was hoping to use them for my workouts, but not sure how that will go because you have to keep your head up straight for them to stay on. Probably fine for walking or on a plane. But not ideal if you’re doing something super active.
