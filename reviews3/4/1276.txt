The OWL is amazing and I am very glad I purchased it. For a small to medium conference room it really stands out. I only have two minor suggestions for improvement:- In a large lobby area the OWL still performs well but does pick up light glare pretty heavily. I understand it wasn’t necessarily designed for a town hall meeting but wish there was a way to adjust how much light it picks up.- Allow for Bluetooth or WiFi streaming of audio and camera. It has to be plugged up to a computer which is fine in our smaller conference rooms, but a large board room that wasn’t equipped with built in cords made a large challenge to attach it to equipment hidden in a closet.Overall I plan to purchase more in future for other conference rooms and am very pleased.
