These headphones are really great. A little sensitive to the touch and takes a learning curve to get used to the touch control features (still haven’t master it, but another few days of usage will do). They tend to stay in your ears quite fine but need to find that unique angle to fit your ears so that the sound doesn’t muffle during movement. The sound comes out really clean for music, streaming, and phone calls (as long as the other person is speaking clearly on their end). The microphone can use some work because people sometimes have trouble hearing what I say so I have to switch back to talking from my phone instead of the head phones. What is cool about them is that they both have microphones so you can use both at the same time or one at a time to have the other ear free for surrounding sound. When I opened them I did feel like they were old tech because of the micro USB charging port installed instead of the new Type-C everything is transitioning to. It does have wireless charging though. The range on these is incredible. I can leave my phone in the center of my house and go anywhere in it and in my surrounding property to throw out garbage and still jam out to my tunes without being disconnected. They also stay charged pretty well, although I cannot vouch for the battery life as I have not yet tested them to the point of drainage, but they do have plenty of juice for a full day of regular use and some, even more with the charging case. Overall, I’m satisfied with my product.
