I was hesitant based on reviews but I’m glad I gave this grip a try. I’m using a OtterBox magsafe case with a 14 pro max and the magnet attachment is strong! It’s almost hard to remove it for charging but that’s a good thing. My only concern is the actual pop socket if it’s going to be as durable. It does seem a bit looser but time will tell. It would be a great idea if they made that part replaceable as it seems to be the only thing that in time would break. On the mention about the sticker issue. Mine did not come with one. Perhaps they changed how it is packaged so don’t worry about that anymore.
