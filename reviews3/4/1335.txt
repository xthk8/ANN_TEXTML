I like that it came pretty much ready to go and install. The wall template is a nice touch as well. Mine was supposed to come with the level and cable straps it said in the description but it didn’t and only a couple of their models do actually. You will need to make sure it is mounted to the wall with lined up in the studs for sure as this is a very solid tv mount. It moves around pretty easily once setup. You will need 2 people to place your tv on the bracket to finish the setup if you’re tv is big I suggest. The hooking notches could be better for sure as it’s not the best for putting on the wall mount when you’re ready to. I think they could improve that a little bit better. As far as it moving up and down make sure once you have it angled right to really tighten the adjuster well. Overall I’m fairly happy with it as it is solid and made fairly well. Shipping was slow and took long considering it came from a city only 5 hours away from me. Thought that was weird. So the cable Velcro straps should come with all wall mounts I believe. I used snap ties to cleanup and secure my cables. Oh and don’t follow the drill bit size for the anchor sleeves as it’s to small for the ones they give you. You will need 2 sizes up I promise you lol. Worth the purchase tough I will say. Just be patient installing it! Took about 25 minutes to install and 20 minutes cleaning up cables and such.Overall 4.3 stars
