Overall these buds are acceptable because of the price. When I am exercising if I have myIPhone 13 in my right pocket the left bud sometimes loses connection so I’ll switch the phone to my right pocket and then the right bud one will go in/out. The best thing is to hold your phone or have it in the center of your body such as a hoodie pocket. The audio sounds a bit flat. The touch controls are terrible so just use your device to adjust level or answer calls. Pairing to phone is very simple. That being said, we’re not comparing apples to apples when people put these against Beats or AirPods so it wouldn’t be fair. These are the kind of earbuds you get as a stocking stuffer where they’re cool while they work but I wouldn’t expect longevity out of them.
