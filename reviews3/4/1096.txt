I got these at a discount so I assume they are being discontinued. For the price I paid they are very good. They easily connected to my iPhone and I use them at the gym with no problem (running, weights). This is my first Bluetooth earbud set so I don't know if they are unusually big but it would be nice if they were a little smaller. Only 3 sets of tips were included, 5 would be better because I think I would like larger ones. I was able to get a good ear seal but occasionally I get a snick sound as the rubber loses seal.Sound-wise these are very smooth sounding with good balance from bass to high treble. The low bass is lacking however (I'm confident larger tips would not make a difference). If you are used to the ultra bass boost a lot of earbuds produce these will seem weak.
