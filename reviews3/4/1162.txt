A convenient design and small size for a portable speaker with very decent sound quality. Strong, clear sound especially in the treble and mid-range. It lacks slightly in the real deep base sound, but this is to be expected with a speaker box this small (it can be connected to second speaker wirelessly which would no doubt enhance the base sound). The speaker can be set on a table top or hung from something with the lanyard strap that is included. I had to make a couple attempts to connect the Bluetooth, but I now have it paired with both my PC and my cellphone and it works just fine. Not an outrageous battery life, but overall, this was a good value.
