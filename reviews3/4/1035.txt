For the price, this is good to start off with. The light has several warm an cool light settings, and several options for brightness.I knocked off one star because this only comes with a usb cord and no actual outlet plug, and the cord is only 5 feet long. So unless you can manage taking you photos right next to a wall, do yourself a favor and get a plug and extension cord or a battery pack to plug this into.
