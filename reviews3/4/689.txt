My son LOVES these, and at their price point, very well worth it. Sadly, the right earpiece's volume went down VERY low after about two weeks of use, and no matter how many resets and re-pairings we did (even on a different phone), the right ear volume stayed low while the left worked fine. I contacted the company's warranty department directly, and they immediately sent us a new set at no charge. Hopefully these last, if not I will be updating my review in the future.
