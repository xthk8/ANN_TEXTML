I’ll list a few things I think are Good, and What’s Not So Great.The Good: Ummm…Owning an iPhone and a Apple Watch I already have a few lightning cables lying around.Not So Great: The cost. They are not inexpensive. I think I got the cheapest pair and that comes with a wired charging case and really not that impressive of features or sound quality. I am not that thrilled with the fact that the right one went “out” on me. I had to google a remedy for that issue. I believe it involved cleaning them and re-pairing them with my devices. It just wasn’t what I expected from Apple. I’m not thrilled with the fit and comfort. I, honestly, have to CoNsTaNtLy mess with the fit so I can EVeN HeAr TheM. I find that to be pretty unacceptable. If they are pushed in to far, I can’t hear them at all. I need to position them just right (up, down, depth, and turned in my ear at the correct angle) so I can hear them. If I’m talking, chewing, or otherwise moving…forget about it, they’re as useless as my nipples. It’s stupid to have to keep messing with them so I can hear them. “Ain’t Nobody Got Time For That!” I’m kinda wishing I would have bought the Amazon Echo earbuds. Alexa is vastly superior to Siri and I’m hoping that the use ability and fit will be better.
