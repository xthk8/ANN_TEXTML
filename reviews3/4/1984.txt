This is compatible with my Apple SE watch, and the diameter and depth of the magnet puck is the same as Apple. I like that the 5’ cable leaves generous slack for bedside charging. The one minor difference is the concave indentation is more shallow than the Apple branded charger. It still works, but when at an angle (as my bedside charger stand positions it), it feels less secure of a connection. It still holds the watch in place and I haven’t had any issues with it not charging, but it could pose a problem if you need a more solid magnetic connection.
