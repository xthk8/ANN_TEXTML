Whenever I am looking for a tv wall mount I always buy mounting dream. They make a great quality product. However I am only giving 4 stars instead of 5 as it appears they have provided few extras in the kit. Several years ago I purchased a wall mount and it came with a small 9 inch level and some velcro tie wraps. this kit comes with a 3 inch level if that and no cable ties. They give you everything else you need to install it but missing velcro cables ties to tidy up wires is something they should have not taken out.
