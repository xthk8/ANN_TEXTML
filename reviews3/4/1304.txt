My wife bought these buds for herself and ended up not wanting them anymore. I ruined her with a pair of Skullcandy Crusher over-ears, and nothing stacks up to them for her lol! I took them from her to try them out. First thing first, I was fully expecting a tinny-sounding no bass, pair of duds for the price paid! Umm, NOT EVEN CLOSE! Once I went into Poweramp app and adjusted the equalizer, these things have great range! Bass is surprisingly responsive through the 65-30 hz range. 8k-16k hz is clear and not overpowering at all. I was shocked! 1k-2k does sound a bit echoey the higher it is set at, so be mindful and lower it to give yourself depth. But, at this price you can't go wrong. Noise cancelation works relatively well. Battery life seems to be as advertised, but I don't have exact measurements. Listen, if you are here then you are interested, trust me you can do way worse and not much better for this price. Kuddos!
