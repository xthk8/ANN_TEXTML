I have a for real giant head so I don't get to just wear any ol' headphones I want. The few I have had that I was able to stretch around my giant melon failed quickly. Some faired better than others but I could always tell that they would fail eventually because they were all tight feeling and uncomfortable. These Q30 phones are not tight, they are totally comfortable. I wear them about 8 hours a day with no discomfort whatsoever and they don't seem to be strained by the massive girth of my cranium. This is truly miraculous. I have tried quite a few of the "big head friendly" headphones and these are the only ones I think will last more than a month or two before they break. If they do break I will be back to update and take away as many stars as I can.So you might be wondering - if these fit your giant skull, mister actual big head person on the internet, then why - pray tell - aren't you giving them 5 stars? Seems a bit odd, don't you think? You have seen the first glimmer of hope for a pair of totally comfortable head phones in your entire life and you are only giving them 4 stars, what rubbish. But the fact of the matter is, dear reader, that these headphones basically sound like crap at anything above half volume. So there's that. In the big scheme of things, all headphones considered, they sound pretty bad. I have heard good headphones and these are not it. I wish to whomever has the power that I even had the option to buy good sounding headphones that were also comfortable atop my magnificent dome. But guess what, if these hold up I am seriously going to order about 10 more pairs just in case they stop making them. So they can't sound THAT bad, right? Right. But they don't sound good, either. I can live with it, I can because I must. I can't stand earbuds.
