Overall this product is decent and serves the purpose for what I need it for. Pros the battery life is amazing, it is aesthetically pleasing, fits comfortably in my ear, and visual battery life being shown on the front of the compartment is a nice feature. Cons: sometimes it's difficult to get the actual earbuds out or back in to the compartment because the earbuds have no grip and they're kind of slippery. The second downside would be the sound quality although it's decent is not as good as some of the cheaper models that I have bought in the past. I'm not saying the sound quality is bad but I feel like it could be a whole lot better for the price that you pay for these earbuds. overall however I will say these fit what I need them for, so if you are looking for just a decent pair of earbuds to get you by or to have by your bedside these will serve that purpose.
