Top line:1. Good, affordable product. Reviews and recommendations for this product were correct.2. Lots of notifications.3. You've got to read the manual; and know how to adjust settings before you take off. It's just too complex (or it was for me) to adjust as you're driving.Bottom line:1. I'd recommend both the seller and this product.
