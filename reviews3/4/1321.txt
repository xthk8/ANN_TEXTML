I bought this because it described it as metal, thinking I could make it fit my s22 ultra with an otterbox case. I was able to bend the arms just enough to make it so I can get my phone in and out easier. I used the cable that came with it but that didn't do the fast charge on my phone. I used the cable that came with the adapter and it does show fast charge. The one that comes with it is USB A to USB C. The one that came with the adapter is USB C to USB C. Works good, sticks good. I love the release is a button instead of a sensitive touch button, doesn't release when you adjust the mount just by bumping the button.
