This is a terrific product. I have a couple other cradles for my phone/watch, but neither of them fold flat for easy travel. I also like that there's a mag pad for charging my Air Pods, and that the lighted border can be turned on or off.Two suggestions for future product improvements (and note - these aren't necessarily negatives, just a couple things that could be improved):* The "kick stand" in back hast to fold up to allow the unit to stow flat. When setting it up (or bumping it when you grab your phone), the kick stand can actually kick out because it doesn't positively engage on the stop tabs. Some sort of engagement mechanism should be considered rather than just touching the stop tabs.* I like that the lip that cradles the phone is a non-slick material, but it could be slightly wider to support phones with plastic cases. I have a mag-compliant case that adds some width to the phone, and sometimes you have to work hard to get the phone to sit properly on the cradle lip.
