i like these headphones, i won’t say they’re necessarily noise canceling because you can still hear things around you but if your volume is up loud enough it will be. the controls on the headphones take a second to get used to but overall it’s pretty easy to use. i will say if you want something that can handle high bass, i wouldn’t recommend, i had to go into my spotify settings and pull down the bass because i was getting that crackling noise. they’re really lightweight and don’t feel like they’re gonna break. the battery life is really long, i have been using them off and on for hours and they haven’t died yet. they are super comfortable against my ears and when i’m wearing my glasses they aren’t uncomfortable at all.
