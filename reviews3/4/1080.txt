I needed over-the-ear headphones due to some ear and hearing issues, and I needed them to include the best possible mic I could afford. I did not want noise cancelling because my hearing is troublesome at best, and I actually wanted to be able to maintain contact with the outside world. Bear these things in mind when reading the rest.The mic is adequate. I honestly expected better, given the price, but it's better than what I had before, so... good enough. Same with the sound quality being "good enough" but not what I expected, given the price (though I write that with the caveat above that my hearing is not the best to begin with, so take this with whatever grain of salt suits your needs best).As for comfort, they are light and not too pinchy on the ears, but they are ***warm***, and I say this as your typical middle-aged woman who is always cold and is writing this review in the winter.Pairing to my phone is quick and seamless. Pairing to my laptop is hit-or-miss: again, I expected better performance for the cost.I don't know if I'd buy these again, but I'm hoping I won't have to buy anything to replace them any time soon, because this is the most expensive thing I've ever put on my ears. Here's hoping they last.
