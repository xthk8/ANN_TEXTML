Been using this charger since 7/2022 for my iPhone 11 Pro, AirPod Gen2, and iWatch. It worked flawlessly. Never overheated like previous ones I've tried, and it comes built in with the iWatch charger, so no need to integrate your own watch charger as other chargers require. Plus it has the Lightning connector for the AirPods since I use the regular AirPods that don't support wireless charging.Unfortunately, about a month ago I upgraded my phone to the iPhone 14 Pro. And this charger no longer works. This is because the new phone's Camera Lens protrude so far that it doesn't let the phone's back go flush against the charger. Because there is that small gap, the phone is too far away and doesn't charge.Unfortunately I now have to look for a new charger that works with iPhone 14 Pro.*DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE THE iPhone 14 Pro
