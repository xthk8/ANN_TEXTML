I bought a pair of these cables to use with our existing chargers for a pair of Samsung A13 5g phones that my wife and I got within a few days of each other. They perform very well and I've used one of them not only for charging, but for some significant data transfer between my PC. The transfer rate was exceptional, especially compared to that from my old USB 2.0 phone (with mini USB connector).I can't speak to their ability to handle the higher charging current that the new phones accept, as our chargers are older and an overnight charge tops the phones off pretty much every day. The 6 foot length gave us plenty of leeway in routing from our wall outlets to nightstands. We haven't had them long enough to comment on their durability, but they appear to be extremely well made and both ends have more than adequate protection to keep them from falling apart or breaking with daily use and abuse.They get 4 stars simply because I am not equipped to test the fast charge throughput. If that had been tested and satisfactory, these cables would easily get a 5 star rating.
