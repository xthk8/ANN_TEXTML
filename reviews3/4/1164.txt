Mine is still charging but they wanted a product rating. I will downgrade if it sounds awful or give it 5 stars if it's the best thing I've ever heard. I was looking at the super cheap shower speakers but they all have terrible play time so I decided to pay a little bit more for a speaker I don't have to charge every night. As others have said it's about the size of a 12 oz can of soda and appears to be decently made.Edit: I've had the opportunity to use it now. It has decent sound although, I wish it could go a bit louder for when there are competing sounds. I only used it for a few hours so I can't speak to battery life yet.
