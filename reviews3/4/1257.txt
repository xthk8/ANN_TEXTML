Turns out this product is trash and the iPhone port stopped working entirely (even with iPhone case off) after about 3 weeks of use. The airpods port still works and so does the apple watch port (but that's a given since it's my own charger). Also - it's very inconvenient to have to put in your own apple watch charger into the port for charging. Pretty ridiculous - put your money elsewhere.UPDATE: the company reached out to me to offer a refund (in the form of Amazon credit) or to replace the item with a new device to make things right as a result of the product becoming defective / no longer working, which I thought was really nice of them.
