These earbuds work well, they are good sound quality and are comfortable. I got these for my husband to take to work, which made it disappointing that the charging case did not have a lid to secure the buds inside during travel. Also, during calls, I can hear everyone else nearby talking loudly enough that it seems they were talking directly to me. If there is any background noise at all, I hear it louder and more clearly than I can hear my husband speaking. Overall, he likes them when he's using them for watching videos or listening to music.
