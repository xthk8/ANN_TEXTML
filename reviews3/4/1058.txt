The sound quality is great, the features are easy to use, and it charges quickly. These replaced my beats earbuds when the Mic went out. With the beats, I could connect either my MacBook or iPhone, depending on my needs. Not so with these. Once connected to the iPhone, you have to forget the device and then hard reset the earbuds and reconnect to the other device.if you're looking for a seamless transition between devices, this is not the device for that. If it is primarily used by one device, then these are great.
