My first experience with decent wireless buds, wanted them for pairing with my music while working out. Was SO surprised the first time I took them out and put them in, they paired effortlessly and INSTANTLY with the music app I had running on my phone. I keep them in through vigorous workouts (weights plus rowing) and have never had to even re-position one.The one feature these buds are missing that would elevate them several stars is volume control on the buds themselves. It's totally dependent upon the device volume setting, so for instance if you're working out and want to turn the volume down for some reason, you are out of luck unless the device you're paired to happens to be at hand (in which case, why are you bothering with buds?) These NEED independent volume control. Otherwise, a great deal, good sound quality, I charged the device once so far, keep picking 'em up and using 'em without having yet had to recharge them.
