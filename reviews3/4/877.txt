I have used these before and they are great for when you only want your computer camera to view you when on Zoom or Facetime or something like that. The only thing I did not like is that when they arrived, in the instructions it states that there have been problems with the latest Apple computer cameras being scratched by the sliding door and I don't remember reading that in the Amazon description.
