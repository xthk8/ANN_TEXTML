I really like my Pixel 7. My last 2 phones were Motorola. Had Razor Maxx HD and last one was a Droid Force. I would of got a Pixel 7 Pro but the phone is to long. Last phone 6.13 and a width 2.88. Then add an Otterbox Defender? Pixel 7 is 6.13. Anyways long story short is phones are getting to long. Maybe just me. I jumped from Motorola Android 8 to 13! I get good updates and Google hooks you up latest version. Motorola. Could not to many updates or none! I did not like Motorola's new phones. Still learning Android 13. Anyways it was upgrade for me, oh and 5g.
