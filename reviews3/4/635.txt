This is my first pair of these buds and I really like them. When I smile or talk they tend to loosen so I had to swap out the liners and learn to put them in carefully. I think that's my ears, not a product issue. Very easy to learn how to use for a first timer like me, just go to YouTube since the manual it comes with is a bit lacking for novices. Never ran out of battery for me and my podcasts and music sound clear and crisp.
