I’m still installing this item. I have the TV bracket installed. The wall bracket on the other hand is frustrating. My lag bolts, well one of them, is a smidge to large for the 3/8” socket. A more skilled handyperson would work around this. I’m not that person. I could run to the hardware store, grab another bolt while ensuring that it fits my socket, but I’m in a walking boot and running anywhere is a whole production. Once I get over this 3/8” socket issue, I’ll get back to smooth sailing. I have never mounted a TV before, didn’t realize the bracket should be in a stud (shame on me), and didn’t know to test the bolts with the socket. I would probably by a mount meant for 2 studs and then adjust the TV for center knowing what I’ve learned in this process. However, I’m going to keep going and maybe this review can help someone else.
