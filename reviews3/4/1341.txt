First of all, I never actually used these. I returned them brand new in the package for a full refund. Their customer service wasn't lightning fast, but they gave a full refund with no hassles. For that, they get 4 of the stars right out of the gate. However, you are encouraged to read some reviews and/or find a pair to try out. My ex demanded these as a present because she saw a TikTok, but I went ahead and read some more reviews. It seems that AirPods tend to win out on most reviews over these ones, and AirPods SUCK for sound quality. Take it from an audiophile with $600 into my headphones and nearly $10 grand into my home theater.
