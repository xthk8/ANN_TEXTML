I went through several car mounts that were just plain awful before finding this one. I had one car mount that after hitting a bump fell off and broke to pieces. With this, I've never had any issues with it falling off and it's very secure. I like the one-touch release of the phone, but I feel like over time that will be the part of the product that will fail or break. Overall I'm very happy with this and thankfully my phone is drop-free!
