Brightness is good, and the multiple settings for warmness and intensity are nice. However, it would be better if the controls were on the photographer's side so that you could adjust the settings without accidentally pressing buttons. The stand is my favorite part, because it has three different heights. It is also very easy to use for a non-photographer such as myself.
