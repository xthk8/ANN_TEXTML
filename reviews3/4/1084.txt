As far as the device goes, it's the best controller adapter I've ever used on my iPhone and it fits perfectly on my iPhone 14 Pro with the little adapter included with my backbone. The hardware design and feel of the device makes it feel like an official Sony designed product not some unknown third party developer.Some of the negative reviews I read here make it patently obvious that they never attached this to their backbone. The other negative reviews I read complains that you can't snap it in with your phone case still on your phone. From a design perspective there's no way they could have accomplished this given the enormous array of iPhone cases on the market. The only phone case you can leave on while using the backbone is the official Apple silicone case which makes sense because of its design that doesn't add any bulk to the phone..My only complaint is the backbone app they created that acts as a user interface to launch all your games and discover new games. It's like having a PlayStation or Xbox interface right on your phone.The app itself is wonderful but they recently shifted from free one year with purchase to only ONE month. After that you need to pay.There's absolutely no reason why this app needs a subscription. It needs to be free. Since the app leads to the discovery and sale of many games they should be getting a kickback for every sale it successfully leads to. That's how they should be compensated for the app, NOT through user subscriptions.This could easily be a 5 star product if the backbone app was free
