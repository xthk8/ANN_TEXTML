I’ll start by saying that overall, this is a great product for the price! I’ve broken everything down below:First and probably most important, SOUND. I’m no audiophile, but I do think the sound quality on these are pretty decent for the price. As for noise cancellation, I would say there isn’t much, but I didn’t purchase for that reason. I work at a canine board & train and I am around various loud sounds, including barking, large fans, and blow dryers. The headband reduces the noise, but not enough that I can’t still be aware of my surroundings, which works wonderfully for me personally.As for HOW IT FITS; I found that the headband was tight enough to keep my hair back and I was able to hear the music, but loose enough that I did have to adjust the band a few times. For reference I am a relatively small-statured woman. I think if you have a larger head, it may be a bit tighter, but the band has plenty of stretch.The CONTROLS are very simple; on/off hold for 3 secs, skip/rewind 1 click, and song up or down long press skip/rewind. Pretty standard and convienient.Overall I think this product is great for only 20, and when I purchased I was able to use a 10% off coupon which made it even better.
