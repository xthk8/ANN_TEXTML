So far so good. For $10 i'm pretty sure this is the best possible headset you can get. Good sound I can hear the highs lows, bass etc. I only take one star because the materials do feel quite cheap when you wear it, but hey its $10 you can't ask for anything more for this price. Sony delivers Amazing headset again. Will buy again if needed. Recommend!
