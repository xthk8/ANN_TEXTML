The genuine brand toner is expensive, and it doesn't even come in full, I do not know if it will provide thousands of printed pages as advertised. However, you do not have much choice since if you buy another toner, not Brother brand as it will not work with the printer because there is a chip built in to recognize not genuine toner.
