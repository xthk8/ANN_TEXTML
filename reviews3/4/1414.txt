Every adhesive-based phone mount I tried wouldn't even pretend to stick to my dashboard, so I had given up on trying to get one, but my friend recommended this one so I decided to give it a try. To my surprise, it stuck perfectly! It stayed on firm with no signs of slipping for about 3 months, and then it suddenly popped off the other day. We did have a couple weeks of ~0 degrees F, so that might have been the issue, but I'm not certain. The bottom of the adhesive pad had warped (looked bubbled almost?).To their credit, I forgot it said the adhesive could be reused by washing, so I didn't try that and just peeled the pad off. However, you can get a 5-pack of the sticky pads for about $7, so even though it did come off after 3ish months, I'm still pretty happy with it overall. It's very convenient!
