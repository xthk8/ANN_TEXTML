Charges well but that will depend on your power source. Some complaints about charging speed are using the wrong usb outlet. Only complaint is iPhone 12 barely fits and it doesnâ€™t hold even when tightened. It tends to sag down especially if you are typing on the screen or driving on less than perfect road.
