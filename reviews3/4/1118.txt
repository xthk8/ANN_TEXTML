I like this phone holder very much, and it is very sturdy and easy to install. Just wanted to let folks know that if you have a Popsocket (or overstuffed credit card slot) on the back of your phone, this can make it difficult for the phone to fit properly in the holder. There are two prongs at the bottom front of the holder that are supposed to pin the phone against the back of the holder. Fortunately, my phone is a relatively slim Pixel 3A and by tilting the phone in the holder, and tilting the holder, I was able to make it work.
