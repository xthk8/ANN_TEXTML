Overall, I like the earbuds. Bought to replace Bose Soundsports that had been damaged. Wear them primarily when cycling and primarily for listening to music.PROs: Not having the cord between ear pieces is nice, especially when wearing a bike helmet. In-ear fit is good and so far no issues with them falling out. Will see how they do this summer when I'm sweaty. Case charger is great. Just drop the buds in and they start charging. For me, music sound quality is very good. It's clear and the app allows for adjustments. I'm not an audiophile though, so others may have higher standards. To me, it sounds great.CONs: An app is required to use. Not a big deal, but it was a different app than the one I used for my Soundsport. Sound quality when using the phone is mediocre. I don't plan to have long conversations on them so the phone quality was not as important to me. If having conversations is important, I would suggest watching some on-line reviews before purchasing. The phone quality is demonstrated in some of them and is pretty consistent with my experience.OTHER: There are no buttons, it is controlled by touch. I'm having a bit of a learning curve when holding for voice prompts and swiping for volume. This is probably just something that takes a little getting used to. If I do get used to it... PRO, if not... CON.
