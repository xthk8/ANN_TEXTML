I've bought them on a sale for about %40 off. Honestly I was about to buy the AirPods Pro but they were too much expensive (I like the ones are in-ear). I usually use them for jogging and biking, and sometimes for some work videocalls.The sound is pretty decent, I have no problem with that. They are confortable and while I am running they are glued to my ears (even with the sweat). That's very important to me.On the other hand, I do not get the noise-cancellation feeling at all. I can still hear whatever happens outside. I tried to attached them in different ways to my ears (using the three silicone tips sizes) but I couldn't get it done (perhaps I am doing something wrong)And finally, I don't know if it is a design flaw or what, but when I am biking at a moderate speed, the wind noise is very high
