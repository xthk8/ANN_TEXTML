Works fine. Disconnects sometimes. Not sure if it’s suppose to be a data cable or if that’s even a thing for the watches. Apple sends the watches out to a repair center so I doubt that it does. This one obviously does not if it’s even a thing. The Apple Store chargers are way faster.. but what do you expect. Your reading this because you don’t wanna pay that high BS price. This one will work. 7.8/10
