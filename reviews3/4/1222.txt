Was a bit clunky as a selfie stick for the base. Worked best as a tripod. The wireless remote to take pictures was wonderful. Definitely helpful for group photos on level ground but a bit leightweight so if ground is not flat, it will topple over from the weight imbalance. Would only recommend using as a travel tripod really.
