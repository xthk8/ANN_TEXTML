I purchased these for my child after having a look at frequency response graphs for inexpensive headphones. The headset seems well built and the white model has remained clean looking despite a toddler having access to it for a few weeks. The ear cups fold and the headset is reasonably compact when folded. The cable seems sturdy and doesn't hold a kink which is good.It's important to note that I look at audio quality from the perspective of an audio enthusiast. In my opinion these are a bit above average for the price bracket but that's not saying much. Out of the box, the bass is over boosted and tuning between 300 Hz and ~3 kHz results in a muddy experience for vocals and instruments. "Bassheads" may like the default tuning but it was bad enough that I created a profile in Wavelet for my kid's tablet that greatly improved the quality. Even with EQ, these lag more entry level audiophile headphones so consider that when purchasing. Overall I think these are excellent value for kids and younger teens that will be rough with or frequent misplace their headphones.
