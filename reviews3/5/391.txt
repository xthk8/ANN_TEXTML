sound quality is actually really really decent for the price, i bought the used ones :). you don't get crazy bass, but you obviously still hear the bass and every instrument in the song & feel the vibrations of it on your head!if you have a little bit curved ears like me, it will be tricky adjusting it onto your ears. if your ears are bigger & curved.it adjusts to fit any head, it extends very long.i just kinda dislike that the circles/speakers are a little small for my ears but it still fits nicely & i love how it looks on me.
