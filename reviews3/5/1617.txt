This is an awesome little PD Charger. It pushes up to 65 watts and truly lives up to that. I paired this with a USB-C Cable that has a digital read out of the watts being pushed through it (https://amzn.to/3XLklKZ), and they pair up wonderfully to power my Microsoft Surface Laptop. I also use this for fast charging my Samsung Note 9. Solid construction, it feels very good in the hand. It's also much smaller than my previous ac charging adapter, much smaller profile for traveling. The actual plug part folds into itself with a very satisfying click, making it just a small cube. I highly recommend this product!
