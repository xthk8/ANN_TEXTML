I ordered this because we were going on a 3 week vacation (including a cruise) and I had loaded my iPad up with some movies and TV shows from Netflix, Amazon, Paramount+ to watch on the plane and maybe in the room during downtime. I also wanted to try to stream YouTubeTV on my iPad so we could watch the last formula 1 races of the season. With this device and an HDMI cable I packed in our luggage, it worked properly in hotel rooms, but the cruise line disabled the additional HDMI ports on the flat screen TV, so we just watched the races on my iPad. However, that was not this device's fault. Also, here's a pro tip: YouTubeTV doesn't work in Europe, so either download programs ahead of time or get a VPN (I use NordVPN) to make it think you're in the US. You should be using a VPN anyway while traveling, so... win win.
