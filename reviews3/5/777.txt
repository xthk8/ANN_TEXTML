Just opened these, and i’ve got to say that so far they are PERFECT. Just like the classic headphones I remember. Bass is perfect, sound quality is crisp, and if I really wanted to, I could blast my ears to another dimension. Thank you friends for providing on such a low price. Also, I am very thankful and happy that my headphones shipped overnight and arrived here rather quickly.I see people complaining about sound cancellation, but these aren’t airpods which were designed to be noice canceling. For the price, these are perfect in every way.
