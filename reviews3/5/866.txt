The magnet connection is pretty strong. I would definitely buy if I’m using the charger that the phone is placed on instead of a cord into the phone. The only reason why I returned it was because I had a silicone case and a traditional pop socket wouldn’t stick on it but when I placed this on my new case it wasn’t silicone and it took up a lot of tue design of the case. Therefore I just returned it. But overall, I would buy it if I didn’t care for it to cover the case.
