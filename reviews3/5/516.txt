This is hands-down the best and most convenient tripod I have ever used in my entire life. I am a content creator and have always had trouble with tripods. I will spend money and have it be wasted because the tripod will break or won’t be able to bend at different angles for me to be able to film overhead videos…etc. when I tell you this tripod literally does it all. I can use it for traveling when I have to film videos at a remote location. And I love that there is a charger for the remote. I have bought several tripods that come with a remote but The remote would die because there was a charger and it was battery powered. But with this tripod I don’t have to worry about that. It is also super easy to set up because all you have to do is slide it up or slide it down and it stays in place unlike other tripods I have tried. I can’t believe it’s so inexpensive. It is literally the best tripod I have ever used. You HAVE to get this.
