👏🏾 GET👏🏾 THESE👏🏾 HEAD👏🏾PHONES‼️‼️These are the closest thangs you are going to get that is inexpensive compared to the real headphones.I was studying reviews for 3 months before I came across these babies and what I came to find was all of the headphones that I really wanted that was going to elevate my bass experience was MINIMALLY over $400. (So when I found these and I tried them out it was the best decision I ever made!)One feature that I love about it the most: TILE!!!! I literally lose everythingggggg! so for me to have tile built in with these headphones is a major Time saver. (if I leave the room at work to go to a different room my headphones will notify me saying the location that I left it at! For somebody who has ADHD that they're mine runs a million miles per hour these headphones are IT)NOISE CANCELING: The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is it's not as noise canceling as I was hoping it to be,(with nothing playing)but that's very minimalistic compared to what I was actually looking for. (Now with the music playing it's pretty great when it comes to noise canceling unless you're working IN a really loud construction site)It brings me back to when I had my car and I had two 12s in my truck it is really an amazing experience with these headphones!VOLUME AND BASS: Whether you turn the bass up or down the volume stays the same. It gets to a decent level of volume.COMFORTABILITY: a lot of people were complaining but I don't see the issue and they are very comfortable on my head I often forget that they're even on my head.they go around your ear and I love that! It doesn't hurt my ears!!! (Major improvement from the past headphones)BATTERY LIFE: it lives up to its word I don't have to charge my headphones for at least three to four days at a time and I listen to my headphones for an entire 10-hour shift everyday.DURABILITY: I have dropped these so many times and they have held up really nicely. They even survived falling off of a ladder!I HOPE THIS HELPS HAPPY HUNTING!
