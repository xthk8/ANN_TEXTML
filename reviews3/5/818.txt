I looked through many reviews (as I always do on every online purchase) and decided on this brand. I wanted a headset that would be comfortable to sleep with, as I require some type of sound to go to sleep. I use my fan every night, but there are some nights when the neighbors are just a little too loud, or sometimes the fan just isn't enough.I don't want some other sound machine that would emit sound that may disturb my girlfriend so I found these sleep headphones. They are not noise cancelling, but the audio quality is very good. The band is comfortable to sleep with, and the earphones are thin, however, they are not very comfortable if you sleep on your side. At first I didn't notice them, but after an hour I woke up with my ear lobe sore. I'm sure you can adjust them to not lay right against your earlobe but when you're asleep you can't do that. I would recommend for future versions to add just a small piece of foam over the ear phones to prevent the uncomfortable feeling.The charging can be tricky. This unit does not come with a charging block, only a cable. But the charge port is USB-C, so I used my phone charger but it didn't charge. I then tried it from my laptop but still didn't charge. I was about to return the device until I did the unthinkable, and read the instructions. It turns out there is a voltage limit and I believe my phone charger was too high. Once I located an old charging block I was able to charge the device. I would recommend the manufacturer to include the required charging block, instead of people trying to guess which one to use.The battery lasts between 6 to 8 hours.Overall I recommend this unit.
