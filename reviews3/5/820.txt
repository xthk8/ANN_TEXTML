I have been laying down to sleep in noise cancelling headphones but they arent the lost comfoartbale to side sleep in - have to make a pocket in the pillow, worry about hurting the earphones by sleeping on them etc. Purcased these as they looked far more comfortable and they had decent reviews. Ive had them for aaround a week now and they are soft, the sound quailty is just fine. im not an audiophile but I dont like harsh sounds especailly as the point of these is to help listen to something to sleep with, the sound is clear, full and volume is more than enough (i havent put it to full yet and its more than loud enough o mid way. I have no complaints about the contoller on my forehead, I really do not feel it there. There snt a lot of noise cancelling BU since the band is across your head and if you have something playing, it does muffle enough outside noise that to hear my husband talk to me I hae to lift the band off my ea if somethings playing. All in all, would very much recommend. Note, I do have a small head, and oI tightened this, although, it fit okay none tghtened. My husband may have found the band a little too tight.
