This Pop-Socket is the best looking one I’ve seen yet. It’s sleek and the smokey black color is nice. Other than that, it’s just like every other Pop-Socket. All of my phone cases I’ve used thus far are plastic, so I never have problems applying any Pop-Socket. Lastly, this Pop-Socket doesn’t easily get scratched or show nasty scratch marks.
