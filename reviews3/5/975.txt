I started using these pop sockets and love them! I thought they looked odd, but my son convinced me to try it. It was surprisingly handy and really helped my very painful hands. SInce you do not live in fear of dropping your bazillion dollar phone, it makes life easier. You can also use it as a stand to look at the phone without holding it. These are reusable and I have taken mine off a number of times and put it on other cases. They are very hard to get off your case, but use a credit card or dental floss or something to slowly pry it off. Then rinse the back of the pop socket with water for 10 seconds or so, let it dry. I have used this same one several times now. This last time I thought there is no way...but it stuck well!!! My only complaint is the price...which seems like for $10 you should get several instead of just one.
