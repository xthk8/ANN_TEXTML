Wouldn't you know it. Ordered backwards by mistake. I can still get use out of them while we wait for the world to catch up with new tech. They worked when I plugged them in. They also feel nice. They have a good weight to them and function properly. These little things feel like they are made well. If i drop them I don't think they would just brake. They attach at both ends very nicely. The type A side slides into port and holds firmly. The type C side even has a little click and holds very nice as well. The type C side held strong enough to suspend an iPhone 14 ProMax and and iPad Pro 12.9. Ordering the wrong one was my own fault, but I can definitely get use out of them.
