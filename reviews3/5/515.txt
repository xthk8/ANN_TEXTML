First of all I’m thrilled to be able to get the tripod in a beautiful pastel blue color instead of just black. I ordered another brand & then while browsing I came across this one & it made me aware that the one I ordered might not be very sturdy, so ordered this one before the other arrived, feeling that I could decide between the 2 when this one came. No question - the other one will be returned! It was flimsy & felt like it would break easily, whereas this one is very sturdy & easy to set up & use. It’s encouraging to have found a quality-made item and for a very reasonable price at this day when so many businesses are cutting down on such things. I also really like that it can be extended to 60” instead of the 40” limit of most others. At Christmas a family member took group pictures of all of us and had to set her 40” tripod on a chair to do that. The extra 20” of this one will avoid that kind of hassle.
