Charges quickly and the length of cord is awesome for home. Great if you have an older car that has no ports in the back seat as it can reach from front port to backseat. Not great if used in front street as it's very easy to sweep it out of the car and slam in car door. It then drags outside which sucks. I thought it was just me who "sucked" but I gave one to my girlfriend and my brother and it happened to both of them. This is why I think it's prefect inside your house. Especially in the bathroom since most bathrooms don't have multiple outlets. Don't say "oh gross" because every person that uses my bathroom say the same thing... that's awesome how it reaches all the way around the bathroom. I use my phone for everything! Especially my alarm clock.One of the things I don't like is the tangle aspect. Very durable material but it can kinkup a alittle.Other than that I've reorder this because the length and quick charging.
