I have been very interested in the idea of using a gimble with my iPhone however after a less than stellar attempt last year I had all but given up on the idea. Yes, the iPhone 14 ProMax does a great job at stabilizing video but its not perfect - and dare I say, the Osmo Mobile 6 just might be. First off, I use this on my ProMax without a case and the magnetic grip holds it perfectly. If you have a case on your phone you'll probably want to take it off for a more secure fit. Secondly, it was incredibly easy to set up and it orients itself very quickly. As for the magnet, I was walking with the gimble shooting video in a 30mph head wind and not only did the phone hold steady but the gimble worked perfectly. As a caveat, when I look back on that episode I wouldn't do it again since I was on a narrow pier over the water but my point is that in even less than ideal conditions it inspires confidence. I find the app to be simple to use and the controls responsive; its allowing me to try new ways to create video with confidence and skill. I'll also say that its very compact and even carrying the mini tripod doesn't take up much room. The little bag is ok but I recommend some sort of case for storage and travel even if you just toss the gimble in its bag into whatever you carry on a daily basis. Bottom line is that if you shoot video this is the tool you need to take your work to the next level. Check your phone's compatibility but, again, know this, a careless iPhone ProMax works perfectly. DJI makes stellar products and this is another example of that commitment to quality.
