i've tried a lot of earbuds and headphones and will always go back to these just because of how convenient they are and how good the audio quality is. they have the same quality as airpods, except they're wired. i used to use headphones exclusively but got tired of how bulky and heavy they felt on my head, so i got some of these and never went back
