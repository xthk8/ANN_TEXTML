I had bluetooth ear pieces years ago and was not a fan. I hated fiddling with them to get them to pair - every single time I used them. Once my daughter got a pair of these, I had to try for myself. And wow! First, I took them out of the box and they paired to my iPhone so easily. Just select the device and it worked. I love that I only had to do that once, and now whenever I pull them out they automatically pair. The sound quality is excellent for such a small device. I honestly didn't expect it to be this good. I'm not an audiophile. I just want good bass and to hear the full range of music (thinking classical with low and high notes). The case is nice and small, and quite attractive. I love that it displays the battery percentage on the outside. Speaking of which, the battery life is excellent. I've had one set for several months and have yet to recharge them. (I use them a couple hours a day) The only issue I had is not the fault of these, but with bluetooth in general. I had them paired to my iPhone, which I leave downstairs at night. I was upstairs and wanted to pair them to my iPad, but there was no way to remove the iPhone connection from the earbuds themselves, and I wasn't willing to go downstairs to unpair from my phone. I don't know if it's technically possible or not, but it would be great to have a button or switch that says 'unpair these earbuds from whatever it's paired to'. My solution - I just bought another set. One for my phone and one for my iPad. They are inexpensive enough that this was a reasonable solution. I haven't tried out the microphone yet, but am happy that there is at least one available. I can't say enough about these - fantastic!
