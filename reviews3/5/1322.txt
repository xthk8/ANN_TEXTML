Packaging was adequate, fast shipping, reasonable pricing, and it is working. I printed off photos that I used as Christmas presents for friends using photos paper of excellent quality, and the photos came out to be perfect. I was very pleased with the quality of the printing at least partially due to this ink cartridge, so absolutely no complaints. It has not run out so I can't speak to longevity actually although indications by the gauge on my printer are that it is doing just fine....at least as expected.
