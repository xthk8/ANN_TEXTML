Watching movies with haptic feedback is like being in the theaters (almost, but still great). They have good sound. Sometimes, I will say, that they either have too much or not enough regular bass when not using haptic bass. Haptic bass isn’t good for sustained bass imo but for periodic bass or beats in music it’s pretty cool. It’s now strange watching movies without haptic feedback. Good build quality and near advertised battery life (35-40 hours out of around 44 I think, that’s with haptic feedback up a bit). The app has some things such as an equalizer but the equalizer doesn’t have any custom modes to my knowledge just 3 preset modes. I wish you could have a custom option to adjust different frequency ranges, sort of like Spotify’s equalizer. Bluetooth 5 distance is great. No interference 60ft away. Good build quality and fitment. Nice little carry bag. Latency is also great for Bluetooth and I do game with them on PC and console. Can’t tell a difference between these and my corded headset (except these sound better, got that haptic immersion factor too). Overall though, pretty d@&m good, best headphones I’ve ever had.
