I was a little leery about these SD cards because they have competitors beat in price by a fair amount. The phrase, "you get what you pay for" kept crossing my mind. I decided to make the purchase because I needed a couple cards for some of my cameras and I have to admit, I'm impressed. No issues to report and they just work. I'll definitely use this brand moving forward providing the cards stay stable and fast. If you're worried about them not working because they cost so much less than the counterparts, don't worry. I've yet to have an issue.
