These are solid power strips and a good value. My only complaint has been the short cord length (but if you're ordering them, you know that ahead of time so it's not unexpected). They work great if everything you're going to plug in can nearly reach the outlet to begin with. Anything further away and you're out of luck. Given that you're likely losing a foot of length just to go from outlet to floor, there's just not that much more reach. I've not had any problems with the operation of these though, they've done their job and haven't had any issues with plugged-in devices.
