As far as authenticity goes, these are the real deal Apple EarPods down to the sealed packaging as well. The volume control buttons work well with no issue and so does the microphone. Audio quality is great and can listen to my music with the volume on blast. Definitely will be buying more if a replacement is ever needed.
