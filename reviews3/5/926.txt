I don't know why it took me so long but I had another tripod I dealt with for a couple of years and it just kept getting worse and worse. I just left a very poor review for that product (Phone Tripod LINKCOOL 360 Degree Rotation Flexible Tripod Travel Octopus Tripod) and finally made the choice to look for something else. I decided to give this one a try and !WOW! The experience is a total night and day contrast. This tripod is sturdy and holds my phone securely. Which was unlike my struggles with the LINKCOOL junk I wish I never bought. With the LINKCOOL tripod just trying to angle my phone or move it just a few inches almost always resulted in my phone popping out of the mount/holster. As someone who does a lot of filming of his DIY projects and has his hands very occupied or wet with paint, etc. this was extremely frustrating. I can't stress enough how aggravating my prior experience was with the LINKCOOL.With the Kaiess tripod I am having no issues. For only about $8 more than the aforementioned tripod I am throwing in the garbage I am getting a MUCH sturdier and reliable tripod. And being able to extend it to stand at 62" in height is a HUGE plus. I just used it today to film some DIY Christmas decorating/crafting and I am so pleased by how much better this tripod is working out for me. Very VERY satisfied.
