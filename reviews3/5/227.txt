After receiving these headphones, I am SO happy I didn’t spend $100+ on an Apple product! I have found my go to headphones. I wear headphones every single day for work, exercise, cleaning etc. I will never buy another pair other than these. They fit comfortably and don’t fall out (they come with different sizes of silicone buds) They get extremely loud which is what I prefer. The range is better than expected. The noise cancellation is great also. And lastly, the battery life is most important to me and I couldn’t be happier! I put these in when I got to work and worked a 12 hour shift, then I wore them once I got home while I walked my dog and did a few chores before bed. They lasted the entire day! It’s been 4 days and I have yet to have to charge the main case. Extremely happy with this product. I bought the pink one and it is the same color as advertised. Can’t get a better headphone for the price.
