I have 4 tripods and this one if my favorite. It is easy to use, lightweight but sturdy, good quality, easy to put in my purse and travel with and it connects quickly to my phone. I was looking for one that could reach my full height and not be flimsy. It is versatile, where I can use the short version on a desk and the longer one for other shots. And I also like that it is easy to open and enter your phone in without much effort. The others I have used require alot of stretching and it tends to damage my phone cover everytime I place it in and take it out. This one it not like that. I am very happy with this purchase.
