I don't know why some reviews are saying this doesn't fast charge the pixel 7 pro but I got it and it works. I used apps to compare the charging between the official Google charger and this one. The Pixel 7 pro fast charges the same exact way. I'm thankful for the small form factor and glad I can charge my laptop with this as well.
