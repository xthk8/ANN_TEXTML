The folding design is perfect and the set I have had for a few years is still solid and reliable. The sound for all I know is perfect. Why worry about imperfection if not noticed or real? I love the way these have held up like new for so long. The new set will go with another device and hopefully be just as good. The price just makes no sense in a good way that is. Seems like they ought to be two or three times as much at least.
