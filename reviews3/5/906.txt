I just bought this as I forgot my old charger at the Hard Rock Hotel... I like this one so much better, so it worked out for the best. My old one was circular shaped, and I had issues with my phone sliding off if I bumped it and even had issues setting my phone on it in the first place. This charger is perfect, my phone fits great on the base, charges very quickly and I just love the light at the base of the charger that tells me when it's fully charged. Very sleek and modern looking too. Glad I made this purchase.
