I was skeptical weather this phone holder would work for my intended purposes and it actually works very well. I have a garage golfing setup and I attach this to a shelf in front of my hitting mat and extend it so my phone is closer to me so I can see it better. It works great and it’s pretty sturdy. I have it extended straight out so the phone bounces a little bit when I try to tap the screen but that’s no big deal. I’ve also brought it to the driving range and screw the base to top of my golf bag and it works great for that too. The arm itself is thicker and more heavy duty than I thought it would be but I like that a lot. I’d buy it again
