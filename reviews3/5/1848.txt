I don't usually write reviews but this detector has paid for itself in less than a week; I commute 30m to work with plenty of road pirates camping out to steal commuters hard earned money along the way. I've had a couple cheaper detectors and the range of the r7 is far better. Any false alerts can be manually muted. Arrows are a must have. I'd say the features in combination with the sensitivity and speed of the r7 make it worth $500. This detector has caught Ka police radar nearly 3 miles out on an open highway. I'm ordering two more for my other cars. A tip for owners, to prevent screen burn-in, leave it on dark mode so the screen is only lit for alerts, it'll prolong the life of the screen several fold.
