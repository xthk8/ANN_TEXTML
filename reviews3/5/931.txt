I bought this for my family trip to Disney! And it was perfect. I don’t have the most stable hands so this was a big help. I watched the videos and it wasn’t shaky and it was a lot smoother than recording with my own hands. Another good thing was the clicker! It saved me having to ask other people to take photos of us. I used my iPhone with the stick so it was a lot heavier but nothing too bad. I held it on and off for 11 hours and my hands and arms weren’t sore.
