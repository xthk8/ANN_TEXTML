I've been using the Crusher Wireless for about 5 years. They developed a soft crackling in sound during this last year, so felt it was time to get them replaced. When I bought Wireless, the 360's had *just* came out, and I didn't know it lol Well I'm not missing out this time. Got the best of the Crushers to date. Evo is basically Wireless, just better. By a lot.If on PC, use your equalizer system to tweak the sounds. The Crusher app that adjusts to "your unique hearing" isn't good, to be honest. I have a ASUS system, so I use Realtek Audio Console in conjunction with Sonic Studio 3 software that came with my board.Using an equalizer is totally optional. You know, after you're done messing with the thrills of the bass slider and ready to listen to your headphones like a normal person :DHow much bass?You will rarely ever need to have the bass slider up more than a pinch. I love bass, and I'm telling you this. With the old Wireless, I always had the slider up about halfway point. These are fantastic for gaming and action movies, too!MicMic isn't good but it's not unusable.ChargeThey really do last a long time and really adds 3 hours per 10min charge.Noise cancellingThe bass is your noise canceller, okay? lolQualityWireless was known for breaking at the earcups. Mine never did and are still in perfect condition. The Evo's build quality is a lot better. Very nice and sturdy. No creaking. They fit slightly snug. Earcups get uncomfortable after an hour but really depends on person. Earcup padding is replaceable can find some after market stuff for something better. I personally don't need to bother.
