I had a couple of wireless pads in the past, but since I've switched to a case with a credit card compartment in its back, I was unable to use them.The coils in this seem to be "better", as in I am able to fast-wireless charge with the phone in such a case (S22U in Spigen case), as long as the cards are not made out of metal (many CC cards are made from thin Aluminum, that might not be magnetizeable, but it is dense enough to interfere).Overall happy with the purchase.
