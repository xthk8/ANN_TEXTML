This is nice and compact, easy to use, and transfers data quickly enough for me. Unfortunately, Pioneer doesn't build their car stereos to accept anything bigger than 32gb, so I can't use it for playing my music with. If they did I would be beyond satisfied. Fortunately, this isn't SanDisks problem.
