After reviewing a lot of radars I settled with this mainly cause the brand name. After using it for months, I bought my wife this same one for Christmas. At first she didn't think it was working because she would pass cops and it wouldn't go off. Not all cops always have their radar on though, so I think that was the case with her.Pros:1) During an alert it quietens down after a few seconds so you can keep the initial volume up, but doesn't stay that volume once it gets your attention.2) It seems to do a great job ignoring the blindspot monitors on other vehicles.3) Affordable for a mid ranged radar detector.4) Very basic so easy to use and has a cigarette lighter plug5) Wide range of volume settings, and I love that it picks up radar in front of you and behind you.6) It's nice to have a mute button.Cons:1) Doesn't have all the bells and whistles that higher priced detectors have.2) I just used command velcro strips and attached it to my dash. I'm not sure that the suction cup mount is strong enough to hold up over time.3) It didn't come with great instructions or manual. I believe they do include a QR code do download a manual.
