I love this thing!! It's a lot easier for me to fall asleep with some sound, but my wife needs silence. So this is perfect. It's very comfortable and the sound quality is really good. The volume level can get very quiet and that is what's needed - I found that in a dark, silent room with my head against the pillow...even a very quiet signal sounds very loud to me. So I need to keep the volume waaay down.When I'm ready to go to sleep, I start a peaceful Spotify playlist on my phone and set the timer for it to turn off after 30 minutes. (The Sleepstories in the Calm app are also great for falling asleep.)But sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I find that starting the music again helps me doze back off. And this is the scenario I wish was simpler. I'd like to easily get the music going again without having to sit up, press buttons on the sleep band, scroll around on my phone, think, etc. In other words, I don't want to have fully wake up and fiddle with stuff to try to sleep again.This band has 3 buttons on it. The on-off button is the middle one; you have to press and hold it for a few seconds. And there's a light that flashes blue or red. With the current design, it's easy to use if you're awake and sitting up. But I wish it was easier to use in the middle of the night when I'm half-asleep, the room is dark and I'm trying to get the band back on my head.I would prefer to completely eliminate the 3 buttons and instead just have 1 on/off switch, where I can feel with my fingers if it's currently on or off. (I have never used the left/right buttons. I have no need for them.)Another thing is that sometimes I end up putting the band on upside down. I can tell by the location of the button panel which side is supposed to go up, but I'd like it to be easier in the dark with eyes closed and a sleepy brain to get it on right and turn it back on (or if it's already on, leave it on).These changes would make it better for me. But really, I love this product!
