I am a big fan of changing cases and always shied away from buying traditional sticky popsockets after a bad experience with leftover sticker residue. Enter the best invention known to man (dramatic? yes...incorrect? no). It perfectly snaps to the magsafe magnet of my case (I have a Casely mag safe case that I adore) and is incredibly secure. I'm genuinely surprised by the quality as I fully intended to return this. Mine didn't come with the weird sticker others are complaining about, so for that I am grateful. The packaging was super easy to remove and the socket snapped right into place. I really, really love this thing. I do wireless charging, so the ease of removal is fantastic.
