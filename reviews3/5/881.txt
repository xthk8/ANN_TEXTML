I am reviewing and comparing two different memory cards, the Amazon basics 256gb and the SanDisk Extreme 256gb card.First is price, the Amazon basics is a several dollars less than the SanDisk (at this moment 23.72 vs 36.99). Currently Amazon says there is a newer version of the SanDisk for 24.85, however I have not purchased or tested the newer version.The two cards:"SanDisk 256GB Extreme microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter - Up to 160MB/s, C10, U3, V30, 4K, A2, Micro SD - SDSQXA1-256G-GN6MA""Amazon Basics microSDXC Memory Card with Full Size Adapter, A2, U3, Read Speed up to 100 MB/s, 256 GB"Tested using:CrystalDiskMark 5.5.0 x64.Computer is a 4 year old "NUC8i7HVK" running Windows 10, and it has a built in SD card reader (Intel calls it "SDXC with UHS-I support"). This interface is what I call "SD reader" in the accompanying screen captures.I also tested using a SanDisk USB 3 adapter "SanDisk MobileMate USB 3.0 microSD Card Reader- SDDR-B531-GN6NN". This interface is what I call USB3 in the accompanying screen captures.First, I noticed a UK review where the reviewer noted the Amazon basics card seems to be missing 5 gigabytes of storage even when the (confusing) translation from computer storage gigabytes (1024 x 1024 x 1024 = 1,073,741,824 bytes vs 1000 x 1000 x 1000 = 1,000,000,000 bytes) vs "we sell storage" gigabytes. You will notice CrystalDiskMark reports the Amazon basic card as 233GiB versus the 238GiB of the SanDisk, so he is very correct. I have no clue why the discrepancy, but it is slightly smaller than it should be.Second, to get the real read/write speed of the SanDisk card, you will notice I had to use the SanDisk USB 3 adapter. Using the built in SD card reader, both cards were very close to identical results.Using the SanDisk USB 3 adapter, I did manage to exceed the ratings for the SanDisk card (up to 160 MB/s read, and up to 90 MB/s write) giving 169 read and 105 write. The Amazon basic card did have a slight change using the SanDisk adapter, but really not significant.Both cards were close enough to their claimed specs to not worry about it, however it should be noted that you need the SanDisk adapter to actually get the much higher speeds of the SanDisk.I will be using the Amazon basic card to store children's movies for my granddaughter to play on her new Kindle, it is plenty fast enough reading to do full HD movies.Note that both cards were brand new when tested and had never had anything written or read from them prior to the test. The Amazon basic seems a good value and is certainly adequate for normal use in a cell phone or laptop. The SanDisk would really shine if you used the adapter to move lots of larger files to it.
