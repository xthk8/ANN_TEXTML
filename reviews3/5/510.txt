I don’t know where to start … other than saying “Fantastic”!!!! Such a useful piece of kit… I’ve been a hold out for such a long time regarding selfie sticks…. But my family and I just returned from a trip to Italy… and we used this stick constantly… in order to get the family pictures and all the amazing historical sites in… we used this selfie stick to the max!!! … totally extended to the furthest points… and what we got were AMAZING photos… ones that we will remember forever. The remote control made taking the selfie photos so easy… we also extended the stick out and used the tripod legs as well… we had to do some last minute production work and having the ability to transform the stick into the tripod was invaluable!!! I can’t say anything more than… this … get one!!!! It’ll make your life easier for selfies, photos or whatever you would need a tripod for…
