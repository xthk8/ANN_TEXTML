I have a few high-quality USB-A connector charging units that I didn't want to throw out just because some of my more recent tech items (fitness trackers, smart watch, etc.) are coming with USB-C connectors on them now. I use these adapters so that I can continue to use these slow charging devices on my older multi-port chargers. Seem to work fine for this use. I'm not sure you'd want to connect high-power charging USB-C devices with these kind of adapters, you may not get the results you think.
