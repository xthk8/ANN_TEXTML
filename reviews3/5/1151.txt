I used this as soon as I got it and my AirPods Pro are almost like new again! The earbuds and the case were both pretty gross and these cleaned everything off. One of my buds had been crackling and I was worried that I might need to replace them but my sister suggested I try this first. A $9 alternative to several hundred dollars and boy was it worth it. Highly recommend!
