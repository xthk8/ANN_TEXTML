For $29 dollars these are a steal! They come as user friendly as it gets; fully charged, display screen, connects to phone immediately, clear sound and voice set up. They are clear, battery lasts long, and relatively comfortably. Most importantly!!!! They work reliably well. I had v expensive sharp ear bud, and like literally everyone in the comment section, the right ear stopped working after a month and after two months they completely stopped working.Cons: Plastic ear piece is cheap and hard. The expensive ear buds I had were super soft in the ear. I could sleep in them. These would hurt to sleep inâ€¦thereâ€™s no way. They also fall out a lot! I canâ€™t do things like change clothes or blow dry my hair bc they come out but just walking they stay jn. The ear piece shape is odd and theyâ€™re hard plastic, but again nothing too bad. And for the price still comfortable enough,Good luck! If in doubt just get them until you find higher end ones you love and use them as your back up pair, or your forever pair. Happy listening ðŸ˜†
