I have an iPhone 14 ProMax. I was kind of skeptical at first, but this pop socket is way better than I expected. My old pop socket stuck on with glue. I use a magsafe charger, so glue would not be appropriate. The pop socket is light weight, sturdy, easy to take on and off the phone for charging. The pop socket sticks to the phone really well. The clear one works well with my clear iphone case. No complaints here. I love it!
