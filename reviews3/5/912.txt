Easy to install. Works well ONCE you use the magnets it came with. I tried putting my iPhone on it just using the built-in iPhone magnet and every bump my phone would fly off. Using the magnets they gave us on the outside of my phone case has resolved that problem.I use this mainly in rental cars. It’s nice to have a phone holder I can quickly and easily install and uninstall when I’m in and out of rental cars most weeks.
