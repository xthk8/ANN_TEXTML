If you are looking for the template that is referenced in the instructions, check the cardboard inner packaging. It is printed on that. I discovered this after having made my own drilling template, but oh well. You can see the one I made in a photo. Easy to do with mount sitting on a table before installing. I also included a photo of the template that was printed on the inner cardboard packaging.Other than that, I am very pleased with the mount. Joints feel tight before install. Once installed with a TV attached, I can feel that the joints should be a little tight, that way it does not move unintentionally. Our 15+ year old 36” TV with built in DVD player (heavier than new model TV’s) went up easily. Range of motion in all offered directions is superb. It took me about an hour to install it on my own, including moving my TV from another wall mount and removing accumulated dust.Lastly, instructions recommend various tools needed for the install. I recommend one additional tool: a 10mm open end wrench. I used that wrench to tighten the lower nut where the mounting plate attaches to the arm of the TV mount. A Phillips screwdriver could be used for this, but using a screwdriver will not allow one to tighten the bolt as well as a wrench would. Considering that the mounting plate is the only thing that connects the TV to the mount’s arm (which is sufficient when used properly) with just two nuts and or bolts, it’s important to be tight enough and secure.
