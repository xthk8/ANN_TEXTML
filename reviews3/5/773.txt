I got these to put in my carry-bag for emergency charging on the road. As you can imagine, this puts a bit of wear-and-tear on my cables – I've gone through two others before deciding to spring for braided ones. So far, my experience with these cables has been a positive one! They show no signs of breakage, and are able to facilitate a steady charge. They also work beautifully when transferring data between computers and other devices. If you need to pick up some short, well-built cables, I recommend them – this is the best brand I've ever tried!
