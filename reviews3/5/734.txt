Bought this item from Apple Store in 2016. It worked great. Finally died in 2023 and I bought this replacement. STARZ and Netflix work perfectly but jerky picture and no audio on Amazon Prime or Spectrum TV App. Have called Amazon, Apple and Spectrum and techs have tried everything. No resolution yet. Using it to connect iPad mini 5th generation to Samsung 5200 series television.Update : The problem has resolved with the IOS 16.3 update.
