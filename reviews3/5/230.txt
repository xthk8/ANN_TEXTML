I’ve had these for 2 months now and I LOVE them. I lose them a lot. But if I turn the volume all the way up and play something, they play loud enough that I can wander them house and hear and find them. They are comfortable in my ear, and do block out quite a bit of outside noise. I tend to only have one in at a time, and I have to take that one out to hear somebody talking to me correctly. The case hadn’t even needed a recharging since I got them. I think I still have 30% left on it too. It displays it beautifully so there’s never any confusion. I have no complaints. I can even turn it upside down and fit it in the opposite ear if I need to (like maybe my baby always in the left might try to get them if she sees them so I wear only one I’m the right ear)
