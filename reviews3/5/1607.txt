Purchased as an alternative to the OEM charger a new HP laptop came with. Also purchased Anker usb-c hub and 10 ft usb-c to usb-c cable. The resulting setup has been a great docking solution for my office at work. Should I need to take it with me, the small size of everything means it takes up very little space in my backpack.Notes:-plugs fold flat into charger for travel; good tension on the plugs so it doesn't wiggle in a wall outlet or power strip-slightly too wide to plug 2 of them in (or this plus any other slightly wide plug) side-by-side on most power strips and battery backups, but small enough to plug a basic power cable in next to it.
