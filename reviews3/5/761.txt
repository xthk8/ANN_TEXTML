Product support excellent. I started a message to the manufacturer and they cut in on their chat line. In short, I quickly learned what the problem was (it was me - operator error). The chat line person very early on asked if I had downloaded the product software update, which I had not. So he suggested that I do that and then we would try trouble-shooting again. So I did that and the problem went away. I wwas very pleasantly surprised at the promptness and professional treatment provided. And this is an excellent and well-made product in my opinion - have had it only 34 weeks now so still learning.
