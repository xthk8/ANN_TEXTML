I have gotten these a couple times for my mom since it's an older printer and hard to find in Staples in stock. I only wish it would LAST LONGER. She doesn't print much and so it sits for a few months without being used -- seems like I have to get her new ones about every 6 months and we only get about 25-30 pages printed total...kindof expensive, but we need to have a printer and she doesn't want a new one!
