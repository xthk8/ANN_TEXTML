As long as your iPhone 12 Pro Max thru the 14 Pro Max has the built magnetic strips on the back of the phone, circle with a short vertical line this will allow for a secure connection with charging devices as well as to the pop socket. Like most conscientious iPhone owners, when a case is used it must have this same magnetic inscription otherwise the magnet from the phone will not be strong enough. Be sure to have a case with the magnet and all accessories will work perfectly. I highly recommend this pop socket for convenience, comfort, and secure method to hold your iPhone.
