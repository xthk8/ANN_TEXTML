I bought a really cute phone case and didn’t want to get a pop socket that would cover up to much of the pretty case I bought. I love pop sockets and knew i wanted to have one for my new phone case so I bought the clear one and absolutely love the way it looks. Since it’s pretty much clear with a tinge of silver sparkle the match is perfect.
