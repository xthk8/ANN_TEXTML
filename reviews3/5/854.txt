Headphones were first set up on my Galaxy S21 Ultra using the (Sony) headphone app. Everything worked as expected. The only observation is that the app tries to get you to use 3 or 4 music apps to experience Dolby 360 music. I use Amazon Music Premium after years of first Slacker then Pandora Premium then here at Amazon Music Premium. Really, the effect of Dolby 360 totally depends on the production of the song. I found the Dolby 360 trial that I did on Amazon worked just fine.My only concern are all the articulating hinges as far as reliability. They appear OK, but I wouldn't abuse these headsets as they may let you down... Not sure. I take care of my stuff.The comfort is outstanding. The frequency response and resulting sound is very good. I'm an old school eclectic Cerwin Vega real wood frame heavy ass 4 way floor speaker guy. Nowadays, considering what I have been trying to use for private listening, these rock. My Samsung buds2 Pro sound good, but I'm tired of frequently resetting ear buds in my ear for fitment!One more thing, I plan on a commercial flight of 3+ hours in a couple of weeks and then I'll be able to rate airplane noise, however, in a home or public space, these headphones have spooky good noise canceling. Only complaint is the app default is full noise canceling and I find myself having to reset that to my liking every so often.Capacitance touch/gesture motions are something that I'm getting used to.NOW THE COMPLAINT ... I easily paired these XM4's with my Dell XPS 17 9710 Windows laptop. However, there appears to be no Windows app or way to adjust anything other than volume... Isn't this 2022?...HHMMMM...unfortunateOverall, enjoying my Sony WH-1000XM4 Headphones!
