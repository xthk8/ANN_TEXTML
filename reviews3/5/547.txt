This cell phone tripod is so cool and the best part is it is so inexpensive. I place it in the middle of the room, and with the remote take pictures as people are milking about. I can use it as a selfie stick. It is so great that I bought three more for my son, my brother-in-law, and my nephew. I recommend this whole heartedly.
