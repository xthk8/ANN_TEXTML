I've been buying Amazon products for many many years and have NEVER been disappointed, they always exceed my expectations. Thanks for Amazon for making quality products and their prompt shipping service. Memory cards came in a very nice plastic case that in my view is amazing for storing, otherwise, any unused cards are easy to lose considering their small size. Plus it also comes with a full size adapter, which is also great as it can also be stored in the case. I've used only one card and my device recognized it instantly, its been few days using this card and its working great.
