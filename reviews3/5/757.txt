I paid the higher Apple price for this adapter to be assured of predictably quality connection and function. I travel and teach groups of all sizes. Whether I’m in an office and it’s a TV on the wall, or an auditorium with a jumbo screen, being able to connect my portable device to anything with an HDMI cable is fantastic. The adapter also includes charging capacity, so your device won’t die during your presentation. Write your name on it though. People covet this thing when they see how handy it is!
