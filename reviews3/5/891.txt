Given the renewed state, I was somewhat worried. When I first received mine, it came empty but Amazon resolved the issue and I am very happy with my purchase.Find My was not connected to its previous owner (this was my biggest concern when buying)Mic quality and audio quality are as expected, very good. I can go 2 full days without ever needing to charge the case. I would just charge it in the mornings before I leave.I've had no issues whatsoever with my purchase
