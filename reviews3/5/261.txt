I received these in just 2 days, which was impressive. I've been wearing them now for about 3 hours and the sound is exceptional and I find them to be very comfortable in my ears. They paired easily to my Samsung TV. I can't speak yet to how long they will operate on a single charge but I will update at a later date if I have any issues. I have to get used to the touch operation to adjust pause, play, volume, etc. but I'm sure it won't take long. So at this point I'm very pleased with these bluetooth earbuds - especially at such a great price! Thinking about a second pair.
