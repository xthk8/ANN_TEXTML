I am so happy to have a phone grip for my new mag safe phone. I saw it on my daughter's phone and she sent me the link. I have so missed having a holder and it's very easy to remove for charging. Occasionally when I have dropped my phone it has popped off, but I drop it much less now that I have something to hold onto. I also enjoy using it to prop my phone if I want to put it on the counter to read something or watch a video.
