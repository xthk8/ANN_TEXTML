Was a little concerned about this, because I already have an external device to manage my monitors. But wanted to add a third external monitor. Also this is a company laptop with software restrictions. Having said all that, I followed the instructions, and everything worked as expected. The install was quick and easy and the third External monitor worked correctly the first time. I wanted to extend the screen across the 4 monitors so I have different things on each of the screens to improve productivityüëç
