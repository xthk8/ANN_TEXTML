We've only been using these cords a short time so I am prorating most of the review, like durability, based on the thickness of the cord, the stability of the plug support and the fit in device ports...all of which are very good. They fit securely, are sturdy, and charge well. The quickness of the charge depends greatly on the block it's plugged in to.
