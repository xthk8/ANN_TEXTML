My Tagry True Wireless Earbuds has arrived today...yeay! And I couldn't wait to try it on when I came home– first thing I did, indeed! As I opened the case, the earbuds were already fully charged and I was able to put them on and put them to the test. Lo and behold, I love the sound of it, noise cancellation is superb which I can actually enjoy listening to every word of the songs and dialogs when watching a movie–sounds like concery/theater audio quality. I am very excited and I couldn't been more happier with this product compared to the ones I ordered which I gave it away as a gift, lol.Wireless charger is not included but able to use my own charger, still works great!Easy to connect with the Bluetooth in a flash.Battery life is yet to be determined. According to the instruction, "music playtime is about 6 hours on a single full charge"...we will see!Nonetheless, I am satisfied with this Tagry True Wireless Earbuds. I recommend this to anyone but you don't have to take my word for it. But I do like my little toy!
