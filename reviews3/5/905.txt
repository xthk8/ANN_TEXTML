Great charging station, unfortunately the included cable is non-functional. (won't power charging stand or charge device directly). Luckily I have longer, good quality, spare C-type cables on hand.My previous Nanami chargers are micro USB and have provided excellent service since 2020. I have used other brands and each has failed within 18mo. Nanami is now my "Goto" charger. I really like the Over Temp protection feature, that alone makes this product a standout! The fact that they just keep on working is icing on the cake.
