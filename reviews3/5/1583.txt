I love the compact size of this charger. Pretty impressed with its performance. As other reviews have mentioned it does run hot when charging things that draw a lot of power like laptops. I took a temperature read and it was about 113-120 degrees. This temperature was still bearable to touch. Over all Iâ€™m happy with this purchase and if I notice the charger runs hotter or I have issues I will update my review.
