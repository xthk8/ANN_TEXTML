I recently purchased the selfie stick tripod and I have to say, the quality is great. I used it during Christmas to take group photos and it was a hit. The stick is very easy to use and the remote control that comes with it was a handy feature. I highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a reliable and convenient selfie stick tripod.
