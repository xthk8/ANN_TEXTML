idc what anyone says cause these r really good headphones for the price-the sound is so balanced and the noise canceling def works like with no music just noise canc. i can literally hear my PULSE and w music it feels like i’m at a concert-i could b exaggerating bc the best headphones i’ve ever had are like airpods but these sound just like the ones-beats and bose-at target and walmart that you can like test listen to lol like SO GOOD
