...where Waterhouse gets Qwlghmsplained by Ghnxh that his flashlight is grossly inferior to the Galvanick Lucipher, so much so that even mentioning the flashlight is humiliatingly embarrassing? No? Well, you get the general idea. After buying a refurbed Dell Optiplex from a repair shop in Vegas, I got it home to rural Tonopah only to discover that the Dell had no HDMI ports. On calling the repair shop, I wound up speaking to the owner, who condescendingly explained to me (a la Ghnxh) that the HDMI interface was hopelessly obsolete and inferior to the modern (and far superior) DisplayPort. Duly shamed for my ignorance, I ordered this adapter, which allows my HDMI-using display to speak with the Dell's DisplayPort.
