I don't normally get expensive headphones, but ever since a noisy new family moved in to the same building I had to get something.It was a bit of a shot in the dark for me, but the noise cancelling really works! These headphones are basically the only thing keeping me sane with all of the stomping, running, shouting, creaking and dog barking. I usually can't hear any noise with headphones and music playing, unless the noise is extremely loud and even then it comes through muffled. I wish the noise cancelling was a bit more powerful so I wouldn't have to play music all the time.That means I have to wear headphones all the time, but thankfully these headphones have a long battery life. I've had no problems wearing them for a whole day and charging over night. They charge quickly too.I especially like the feature where taking off the headphones pauses the music player, podcast or video you are watching until you put them on. It's also easier switching Bluetooth connections between multiple devices compared to other headphones.Some small nitpicks:- The headphones are a bit small for my head and the adjustments only help so much- Sometimes the headphone say they are connected through Bluetooth, but no audio comes through- Sometimes a loud noise plays and the headphones are disconnected abruptly. That noise should be quieter.- It's easy to accidentally trigger the swipe feature by brushing the side of the headphones against something else, but this hasn't been a big issue for me
