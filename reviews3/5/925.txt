I had my small selfie stick I bought a few years ago, but it doesn't support tripod stand mode or remote so I had to ask someone to take a picture of my family when using my iPhone. Also, I wanted something to take a video when I play piano. I have GoPro and a small tripod for it, but it's not the most convenient option when you want quick shot - check - delete - shot again mode.So I bought this to hit two birds with one stone, and I am satisfied so far. It even has a remote and remote holder on the body. Tripod mode is okay enough for any latest smartphone, but if you fully extend this stick with tripod mode.. then it might not be that stable for you to use it for any heavier items like DSL or others.Also, it was quite big than I was expecting, especially compared to my previous tiny selfie stick, so it won't fit into your shoulder/cross bag and probably would need a bigger backpack or hold it in your hands all the time.It comes with another GoPro mount part, so it's another good thing if you already have GoPro and wondering if you can use it for GoPro. Yes you can definitely can use it for GoPro.
