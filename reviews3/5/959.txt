I switched from an inkjet printer to a black and white laser printer when I did some simply arithmetic and determined that the inkjet was a total ripoff when it came to consumables. Since I stopped printing pictures when people started just looking on their phones I had no use for inkjet.Brother makes a rock solid line of laser printers and I'll happily spend a few dollars more for supplies that come from them. Life is too short to be messing around with printers This is a good value.
