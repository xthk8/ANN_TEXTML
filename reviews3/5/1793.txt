Thing thing is worth the price and has saved me from many tickets. I recommend putting it on automute, and putting it on the second highest sensitivity. And actually read the manual so you know what all the buttons do and have to set it up correctly. I will say though the stock suction cups suck and I had problems with them. I'd recommend you get aftermarket ones they have 3 section cups and are deeper then the stock onew and they'll do the trick and your radar detector won't fall when you have the defroster on in the winter or in the hot summer. Other than that I have nothing but great things to say about this radar detector. The worse feeling is when the laser noise screams out at ya, you better slow the down when that happens lol.
