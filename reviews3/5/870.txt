I bought this to add to my Smartish iPhone case and itâ€™s honestly one of the best accessories Iâ€™ve bought for an iPhone. I have an iPhone 14 pro (non Max) and the cases I had prior kept falling in my face or falling on the ground due to the case being slippery, but Iâ€™m happy to have a nice ðŸ˜Š popsocket with a strong magnet. This is my first popsocket ever so I would love to know how to take the pop socket off easily since Iâ€™ve tried to take it off and it wonâ€™t budge!I hope popsocket makes it easier to take off the pop so I can replace it but otherwise, Iâ€™m so happy!
