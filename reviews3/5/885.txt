I bought 5 of these 128 GB MicroSDXC Memory Cards complete with full-size adapters to install in my home camera system. They work great! No where else could I have gotten such value in a quality product for an awesome price! If you're in doubt, don't be. These are just as good as the name brands I used to spend more money on! So glad I decided to give them a try! Won't hesitate to buy more if needed.
