I was a wire-only self-proclaimed audiophile who struggled to find those pair of cans that deliver the perfect sound disregarding the song I throw to them (I listen to jazz, prog rock, extreme metal and some pop). I arrived to my Audeze LCD2 classic closed paired with a Astell&Kern sr25 and stopped my searching because such combination just touched the 'sweet spot' of my tastes.However, I just bought these Soundcore A40 due to the practical convenience of isolating myself a bit better when I clean my house, I saw some good reviews and then decided to give them a try.It's weird, because now I can't work at home or do the house chores without them, even sitting at my desk. After the hearID procedure I can distinguish many frequencies very clearly which produce a surprisingly defined music, with layers, details and texture. Of course, they don't have the refinement of the audezes, but they do present an engaging musicality.Plus, their less than 5grams per bud and simple operation make me to use them for hours (perfect when in hot weather compared to my big and heavy headphones).The noise isolation works fine, for instance, even though I can note the vacuum when cleaning, it's nothing of consideration. I had a pair of Sony's WH-1000XM4 and I would say that these soundcore are just a bit weaker in terms of noise cancelling (by the way I really prefer the sound of these a40 compared to the sonys).Perhaps something negative is the somewhat flimsy feeling of the charging case cap. I wondering whether soundcore offers replacement cases, just in case.In conclusion, in terms of music enjoyment and wireless convenience, these a40, for such price, is an easy recommendation.
