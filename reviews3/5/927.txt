This product is the best thing I’ve ever spent my money on!!!!! I went to Europe and this was in my luggage that got lost for 2 days so In that time I had to keep handing my phone to someone to take a picture of me which mostly gave my anxiety the whole time thinking someone might run off with my phone. They also didn’t always get the right view behind me or the right angle. But when I got my luggage finally this thing took my photos from like a 2 to a 10000000000!!!!! It is amazing for recording while walking, the camera doesn’t shake, it’s amazingggg for selfies!! And the best part it’s phenomenalllllllllll for taking photos from a far like full body!!! I swear I can’t recommend it enough, also I never write reviews but this one was just too good!!! Extremely recommended to all who want a literal tripod to take full view photos!!! Just buy it already!!
