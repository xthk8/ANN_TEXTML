Finally! A cord that takes my abuse.These are the only cord that haven't failed over time. My wife likes them too.The cords that come with my fast charger are too short to reach a plug. UGGH. This has a longer cord making it much more useable. I can sit in my chair and use the phone while it is charging. My fast charger complains that this isn't the cord and charger that came with my phone but I BROKE that one. and my wife lost hers on a trip.This cord is rugged and charges fast enough, Enjoy.
