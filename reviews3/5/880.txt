I got these headphones a while back after my previous Bluetooth ones broke because of a nasty fall. When I first got these, I was honestly a bit disappointed with them. The noise-cancelling was alright and the pass-through was great, but the sound quality was... mediocre at best. I'm no audiophile, but it was noticeably imbalanced.Then I got the app.That's what made this go from a 3-star rating to a 5-star rating. I was able to adjust the sound to how I liked it. That, when mixed with the decent enough noise-cancelling and pass-through (my most used feature), made this an easy 5-star rating. While it could certainly be better—the noise-cancelling struggles with higher sounds and the pass-through has sounds merging together, relatively common issues at this price point—the bang for your buck is superb.Also, the battery is insanely impressive. I don't use them too often, but I'm still yet to have them drop below medium because it takes so long and the battery recharges (through USB-C, another bonus) super fast. If these headphones ever die, it'll probably be because the sun exploded.One big complain I have, however, is that plugging them in using a 3.5mm headphone jack disables a lot of the features. The big three for me, though, are the noise-cancelling, pass-through, and audio adjustments. Normally headphones have a higher sound quality when plugged in rather than over Bluetooth, that is not the case here. When I plug them in, there's an immediate dip in sound quality as any adjustments I made aren't used (an issue more with the lack of internal storage than anything). On top of that, the noise-cancelling and pass-through are disabled which can be annoying. Luckily, this isn't enough of an issue for my experience to warrant a drop in rating as I almost exclusively use them with my phone while walking, but it might be an issue for some people.Overall, fantastic value and some great features, but make sure to get the app and not use the 3.5mm jack.
