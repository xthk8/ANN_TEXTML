I wanted a pair of these headphones because I thought they sounded really good the first time I heard them some years ago and wanted some cheap headphones that still sounded really good. I'm not sure if these two are the same because the ones I remember had really good bass (2017) and these one, they sound like cheap headphones. Nothing wrong with them, they're a solid wired earbuds if you just need something small that you can fit in your pocket. They're comfortable to wear and stay in your ear, at least for me.
