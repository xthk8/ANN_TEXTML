If you're reading this, we're probably still in the weird middle years of USB-C adoption and compatibility. If you are like me and have several USB-C devices and various cables with different capabilities (especially when it comes to charging devices), but still have a few USB-A ports to spare, this adapter does a couple really nice things:1) It adapts your old ports to USB-C without losing any of their original functionality. This is nice for car ports and older machines that haven't moved entirely to USB-C. You can convert entirely to USB-C-to-whatever cables without having to worry about not being able to charge your phone when you're out in the world.2) it actually expands charging capabilities for certain setups. I have some USB-C-to-USB-C or lightning cables that provide TOO MUCH power for certain devices. They just need 5 or 10w charging, but not every dock or device is smart enough to throttle power and leave you unable to charge your Airpods Pros unless you can find a low power port. Now I just keep one of these on a cable that's dedicated for low power charging.
