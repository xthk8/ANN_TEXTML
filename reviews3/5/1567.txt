I searched for weeks for a solution how to dock my personal laptop on my work monitor station and I almost gave up and bought a new laptop. I still have to move the usb keyboard/mouse over but this connects on one usb with two hdmi cords to my monitor. So streamlined, and I didnâ€™t have to trade my laptop in.
