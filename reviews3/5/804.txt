I did a lot of research before buying these and it paid off. I didn’t want the cheapest or the most expensive, I wanted the best quality at the mid price range. These have proven themselves with daily use including multiple commuting hours per weekday, survived dropping, and unchanged sound quality since we bought them 9 months ago. Just bought a 2nd pair. The bass is excellent, as other reviews said, and it’s noise-reducing (not 100% cancelling, which I prefer, feels safer when around others).Highly recommend.
