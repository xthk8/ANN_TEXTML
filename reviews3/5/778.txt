I was tired of the wireless earbuds as they don't stay in my ears as well as the original wired ones. The sound on these is great for what I use them for...mostly playing games on my iPad and browsing TikToc. My husband goes to sleep earlier than me and these let me continue enjoying being online without the sound waking him up or bothering him!
