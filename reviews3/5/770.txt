I have used these cables to charge my GoPro and my wife’s phone with no problems but tonight I tried to charge our Nintendo Switch Pro controller and I am lucky that it didn’t start a fire. This is probably my fault for not knowing that Nintendo recommends against using any off brand charging equipment for their stuff. This meant as more of a PSA for anyone trying to charge their controller. I don’t consider this Anker’s fault.
