Hands down buy this! It's the perfect tripod. It can be short or tall. You can even make it work as a selfie stick. It is everything you didn't know you needed. The remote is great, as it is small enough to be hidden in your photo and has a pretty decent range! The best part is how compact it is. It simply collapses into an item that can fit into most size bags. As for sturdiness I give it 3 out of 5 stars; it's not the most sturdy thing, but nor is it flimsy. I believe it could take a tumble over and be just fine, but I wouldn't let that be a regular thing. But seriously just get it, you won't regret it.
