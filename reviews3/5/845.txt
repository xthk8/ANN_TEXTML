Gave this to our parents for Christmas. Easy for us to set up. Easy for them to put on their wifi network at home.I would definitely have it shipped to you for initial setup and then give to grandparents. Setup is easy but… you know… grandparents are grandparents. It will also give you a chance to get acquainted with the device so you know how it works if they have any questions later.Gave as an early present to one set of grands right after Thanksgiving so they have been using it since then, and I’ve been using the app since then with no problems.App allows you to put all frames on your account and to send pics easily, simultaneously to all of them.Especially great if you have dealing with multiple sets of divorced parents and in-laws who can’t all exist on one text thread to get pics at the same time. With the frames, they can all get the pics at the same time but there’s no risk of them interacting with each other. Win-win.
