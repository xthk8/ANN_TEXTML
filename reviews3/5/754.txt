I bought this adapter to use my IPad and iPhone with my pico projector. Before purchasing it, I would have to transfer images that I needed to an old laptop via email, then transfer them to Word to edit in the way that I wanted it. Slow process and slower laptop. This adapter works perfectly with the same HDMI cable that I was using for my laptop. Love how easy it is now to project my images onto my work!
