I have purchased 3 of these frames now! 2 as gifts and then one for our home. Easy to set up and share your information with those you choose. We have family throughout the USA , it’s such a fun surprise to get the added photo tab on frame, touch it and then see a face you love or fun event of someone special in your life! It’s a daily smile. I set up for the great grandparents and they absolutely love it! Nice frame. Easy to use. Either to add or delete just a simple touch! Even for those of us technically challenged older adults- it’s GREAT!
