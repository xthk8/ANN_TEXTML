I'm a sucker for a bargain and always trying out Amazon Basics branded items when I need them. They're almost always a great value. But even I was still hesitant about them hawking cheap Mirco SD cards. Especially with these specifications, features and advertised speeds. But here I am, fully satisfied and impressed. They deliver.I figured that worse case scenario I'd use them on less demanding gadgets. But you can slap one of these in something like a Steam Deck, install a AAA game, and notice no difference from a quality line of name brand cards. Now maybe the quality control is lower, and/or maybe they have shorter lifespans. But I bought two 256gb cards and both work fine. On anything from gaming devices to tablets to cameras and so on. Transfer speeds are there in both read and write. No reliability issues at all. I've had no issues with data loss in mounting/unmounting. And they've been holding up so far.With so many gadgets these days using the Micro SD format I'm starting to have quite the collection. I've got stuff like Samsung EVO Select's and Pro's. And then I've got stuff all the way on the other end of the spectrum like unbranded generic ones that die the first time you eject them from the device they came with. I am very comfortable in saying that these are performing for me like the Samsung's on the higher end of the spectrum. With the prices these go on sale, there's no reason not to add them to your mix. You can always use them in less important or demanding devices if you don't want to trust them. But like I said, I'm using them in demanding devices with regular heavy use and they're up to task.Definitely recommend them.
