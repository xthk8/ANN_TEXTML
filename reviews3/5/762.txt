Used this for a trip to Europe and it was very good. Only issue I really had was carrying it with me all the time as it can get heavy when you are walking around all day. Also the ramp up time to using it is a little bit longer than I would have thought. What I mean is it was difficult for me to navigate and use, I don't know that I still completely understand all of the cool ways to use it either. All that said its an amazing tool and works great.
