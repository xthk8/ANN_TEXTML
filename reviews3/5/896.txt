Just like the title states. It is an SD Card with 32GBs of memory for an amazing price and you get the peace of mind that you bought a SanDisk product. Personally, I've never had any problems with any SanDisk product, so that speaks volumes about their high quality, but if I were to have any problems, then SanDisk's warranty gives me the peace of mind I need. Item was delivered overnight and since I needed an extra SD card fast, that was an amazing feature to have with Amazon Prime. Speeds are decent and just what I needed for my application. It won't make you a better photographer, but you can be sure that all your shots will be there when you need them. Would repurchase again at anytime in a heartbeat.
