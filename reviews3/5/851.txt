I will start this review by stating that I am not an audiophile. I know there is a law of diminishing returns when you get past a certain point in the pursuit of audio reproduction. And while I have owned decent systems and headphones over the years, I have not been one to chase those last few precent that leads to exploding costs.That said, I have thoroughly enjoyed studio monitors and headsets from AKG to Sennheiser. I have been nonplussed by sets that others raved about. I have been pleasantly surprised by underrated gear. I place these phones in the category of the latter. It may be that the tuning specifically matches the anomalies of my own hearing.... But these headphones have blown me awaySounds are well rounded. Bass is smooth and full without muddying the waters or overwhelming the sound. Vocals ring out clearly. Drums stun me. I hear the decay of each tap, separated out. For reference, I listen to Florence + The Machine, Miles Davis, Steely Dan, Smashing Pumpkins, Mitski, Everything But The Girl and much more. These headphones have played nice with all of them.Noise canceling is fantastic. I work from home and have a world of distractions I need to make go away. These have suited my purposes well. I can't speak to how they measure up on planes, trains, etc.I know the XM5 is supposed to offer marginally improved performance across the board... And maybe that is true. But these have proven to be tuned well to my hearing, are supremely comfortable and make the outside world melt away. And they were a flat out steal at the black Friday price point where I got them. That said, I would be no less happy had I paid full price.If you are debating, stop. You will NOT be disappointed with these headphones!
