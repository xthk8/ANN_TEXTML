The clear plastic does cloud up over time. Adhesion is good, it doesn't come off in the eighth circle of hell that is my purse. It only lost grip when I stuck it on where a cheapo pop socket had broken off, leaving paper behind. Of course paper residue will inhibit current and future sticking, can't fault it for that.I've tried off brands and Dollar Tree pop sockets, and they break, fall off, and don't do the job. Which is why the brand name is worth the money: it sticks out. It has saved me a hundred dives under the couch. You can play with it and it won't break.Putting another one in the cart!
