Bought this tv mount for our living room and 55" tv. It holds the TV just fine and allows for plenty of motion. Worked so well I bought two more for our bedrooms. Used them for a 42" TV and a 40" TV. Worked great for those sizes as well. Installing was supper easy to do. I recommend having a second person with you to make it easier, but it would be possible to install on your own depending on the size of the TV and how much time you want to take.
