I’m a Certified Implementer for EOS. I go through tons of these sheets when working with leadership teams. I never worry that the paper won’t stick. I never worry about ANY bleed through because the paper is that thick, or that the paper is too small like other pads in the market.I never want to worry about running out. I love these Post It pads.
