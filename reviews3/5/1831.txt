I've been researching radars for a few months and this model has consistently been in the top 3 on almost every radar review that I've read. I've been using it for about a month now and already it's saved me from a few tickets. It's very accurate and picks up almost all Ka bands I've seen. There's a lot of settings to configure so I'd recommend watching one of the many YouTube videos out there on setting this up. You can change the sensitivity levels on the different bands so you don't get as many false alarms around the city. Overall, I'd say this is the best radar I've gotten for the money!
