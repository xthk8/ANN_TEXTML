I loved this product while it lasted. It was so helpful to watch shows in my bed at college so I didn’t have to hold it in my hands. It snapped just today, roughly 6 months after I bought it, I just wish it would’ve lasted longer. It also shook sometimes, but was mostly stable.Updated: company is so kind. Offered a full refund even when I wasn’t expecting a response at all. Amazing service(Switched from 3 to 5 stars)
