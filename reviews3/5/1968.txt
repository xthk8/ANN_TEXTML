I use this product to write out the practice schedules for my cheer team, and it is the perfect size so all the girls can see even from the back. It also has a whole at the top that makes it easy to hang up the whole pad if need be, but the adhesive works very well too. So far, it has stuck to all surfaces for as long as I need. It has never fallen down unexpectedly I always end up taking it off. The price is not bad either considering there are 4 pads and each pad lasts a decent amount of time. Finally, these are pretty one of a kind there is no product that can accurately replicate the jobs it does making the price worth it.
