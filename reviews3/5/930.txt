I've used this tripod with many different cameras like DSLR (Sony Alpha a7iii), GoPro 7, iPhone 13 Pro Max, and insta360 x2. The tripod is sturdy and great value for money. I like the design of it and it holds the weight of all of my cameras. I've traveled with it, it's lightweight and folds well. It fits well in my backpack.I've even used it in the ocean water with insta360x2, the screw on top can be improved so it won't rust.Buy it and you'll never regret your decision. If I need, I will buy it again for sure
