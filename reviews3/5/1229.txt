The audio pick up is amazing so you can take calls easily. The touch controls are also great and don't trigger accidentally. They fit amazingly well with a very low profile. The hear thru is decent, but definitely limited a little by the price point. The ANC is also very good for the price.The wind reduction is one of the only mediocre aspects of these, but that's way above the usual quality you usually get at this price point. With wind Noise reduction and hear thru together don't play very nicely. The wind Noise reduction over compensates the audio bands and just muffles them all when any wind noise is detected. The higher end options with this feature all silence only the specific wind noise and allow the rest thru. What you end up with here is what sounds like hear thru kicking in and out, but it's actually just all non-voice frequencies being muted whenever the wind picks up.The voice-only hear thru setting is absolutely amazing though.I would strongly recommend these if you're at your budget limit. However, the best in class for all the features these also excel at are only $100-$120, Jabra Elite 65t and 75t (not the newer Jabra 85t, or 7s), so if you're willing to spend some more you can get the literal best.
