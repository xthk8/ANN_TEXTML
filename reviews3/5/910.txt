I have a 2019 Honda Civic and this fits beautifully in my car! I was scared that was not going to like it because I originally put it on the left middle vent. I then moved it to the outer left then and it fit perfectly! It definitely does a good job of staying in place if you follow the directions and secure it to your vent! I'm so glad they created this because in the past I would buy the car holders that would need to be secured on top of the dashboard and those would always fall no matter how closely I follow the directions. This truly stays in place and it will not go anywhere! It also comes with five extra magnets in case you want to change up your phone case.
