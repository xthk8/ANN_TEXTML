This thing rocks. Picks up almost zero interference and spots these guys easy. Just get it. Cost of a speeding ticket around where I drive is roughly $75 more than the cost of this radar's price tag.In other words: It more than paid for itself in the first 5 minutes because I would have been out $200 for a ticket. Just buy it.
