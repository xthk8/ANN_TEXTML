I didn't even know this was a product category until a friend bought an off-brand one. Then I researched them and decided if I'm going to get one, I'm going to get a decent one so I went with this one from DJI.I'm incredibly impressed how good handheld video off of this is. It's like you're on a tripod or, if you're walking around, a dolly. I took videos of our Christmas display with it, and comparing them to a prior year's handheld ones was night and day different... as if I'd hired a camera crew.I don't have too much bad to say about this. One thing is when I remove my phone from it, I feel like I'm harming it as it fights me until the phone is removed. The photos you take with it on iPhone through the Mimo app aren't live photos, but that's not a big deal to me. Some features of the app are a bit obtuse but in general its very easy to use.As the title said, I'm very happy with this purchase, and it's a game changer for using your phone (which if you have a recent high-end phone probably contains an excellent camera) for video.
