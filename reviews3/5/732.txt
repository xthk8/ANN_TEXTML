Worked flawlessly on two different monitors/TV that I used it on. My phone (iPhone 14 Pro Max) did say it was downloading firmware when I first plugged it in, but I waited a minute and then tried mirroring and it fired right up. Works flawlessly, no input lag whatsoever. My only small gripe with this is that you cannot have the audio play from your phone or another device with this hooked up. I originally wanted it for the gym area, and had it hooked to a monitor without speakers built in and it was silent...which is not what I wanted. Hooked it to a normal TV and of course it works fine. Still, good to know ahead of time if you were thinking of a similar use-case. I would recommend this directly from Apple product as compared to a lot of the other ones on here that claim to do it for less. You get what you pay for, and reading through reviews for this type of product I saw a lot of inconsistent products that sometime worked and sometimes didn't. Don't risk it if you have an Apple phone and just get this one.
