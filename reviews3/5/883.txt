This card has been working just fine for me in my switch. I had no trouble getting the switch to format the card nor with transferring the data from my previous card that was saved to my pc. Popped it in once it had my data on it and haven’t had any issues. The read speed is as fast as the switch can utilize. If you’re using this card in a device other than the Nintendo switch, check your device’s specs to see if the speed of this card is fast enough for your liking on that other device. I do recommend this card and would buy it again or use the same brand if I get a higher capacity card in the future.
