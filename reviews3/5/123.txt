I travel for a living so anything that can make my life easier is a win in my book. Most newish hotels have USB wall plugs to charge your devices but with an Apple Watch, phone and IPad that all use a USC cable I had to bring 2 international adapters and an an extension cord to charge all my devices including my work tablet. Know I just plug the USC cable into this adapter and plug into the USB outlets. Easy Peasy.
