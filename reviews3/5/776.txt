The noise cancellation is not that good and arm so if you just like want to like listen to music, I like call somebody it doesn’t really work that well if you call somebody cause noise so like you would have to go inside a separate room like go outside to hear them better at least an alarm, so yeah I know I schedule a should just isn’t really that good I mean maybe if you turn it all the way up it might be a bit better, but yes, that the noise cancellation is bad .
