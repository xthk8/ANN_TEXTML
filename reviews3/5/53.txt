I let me iPhone 12 Pro drain to the 20% mark when it warns you and asks if you want to use “low power mode”. I then plugged it into this charger. I waited exactly 30 minutes to test their claim of up to 50% charge in 30 minutes. In that 30 minutes it went from 20% to 68%. So 48%, pretty close to the 50% claim. I went on to let it fully charge my iPhone 12 and it did indeed enter the standard charge mode at the 80% mark as claimed to avoid the overcharging or damage to the battery. The charger got slightly warms but not overly so. It didn’t feel like it was “overheating”. The included cables use the rubber coating that feels very durable yet pliable. It feels high quality. This pack includes 3 sets which was very convenient for me to just have them plugged in and ready at key locations around the house. I tried it on an iPhone 5, an iPhone 8 and a 2017 year model iPad Pro as well. All devices worked well with very similar results. Overall I highly recommend these chargers and it’s an incredible value for the money. When I bought them the were on special for $20 but even the normal $30 price is a great value for 3 sets. That’s $20 less than 1 set from Apple! Overall the chargers and included cables feel very well made and durable. I would absolutely buy these again and recommend them to friends and family.
