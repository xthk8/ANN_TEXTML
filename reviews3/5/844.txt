Bought this as a Christmas gift for my parents. Set it up in advance and shared the frame in advance with their kids and grandkids. Quickly sent them dozens of pix that were on it when they turned it on. They connected it themselves to their wifi and received all the new pix.Love this frame and the ability for us to include them. The only thing I'm less thrilled about is the need for a service so I can manage this for them (like deleting my brothers work photos he didn't mean to send). That said, it's a great frame and great gift. They love it
