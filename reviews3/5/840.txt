I have a Blue Yeti X Professional USB Condenser Microphone and needed to use it with my Macbook Pro. Being that the Yeti only connects via USB and my Macbook is USB C I needed an adapter. I've purchased third-party adapters before and sometimes they just don't work. So I went with the Apple route.The adapter works great and I'm glad that I made the purchase. I recommend this adapter to anyone that needs to connect their USB device to their USB-C computer.
