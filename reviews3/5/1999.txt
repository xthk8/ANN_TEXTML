I’ve had these headphones for close to 6 months and overall these headphones are awesome, especially considering the price. They are a pretty soft color, great noise quality, sit really well without slipping or sliding, and are perfect for everyday use. The noise cancelling is pretty good (considering the price); with music on i normally can’t hear anything else and without music it mutes background noise. They keep a charge forever- like i couldn't tell you the last time i charged them. i especially love these because i have new piercings and they never bother my ears! They are great for studying, working out, going on hot girl walks, or just trying to be as antisocial as humanly possible. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a simple affordable pair of headphones!(they look more green then they actually are in my pics)
