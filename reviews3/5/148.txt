I bought my daughter a speaker bar for her computer; and it came with a USB-C charger cord. I plugged the speaker bar into a regular outlet, but it didn't work. On a whim, I purchased this. As soon as it came, I plugged this into the USB port on the back of the computer and plugged the USB-C cord into it and it INSTANTLY had sound come from the speaker (a video or something was playing while I fiddled with it).Very happy with purchase!!!
