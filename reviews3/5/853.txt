I have a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II and I can honestly say that these Sony XM4s are hands down better in pretty much every area - sound quality, noise reduction, comfort, pretty much everything. I have only had them a day and the touch controls are a little strange, but I put them through the paces and they are pretty much amazing. Honestly, I am a Bose fanboy - so if I'd prefer these over a Bose product, that is honestly saying something. I have no real cons, but I will tell you that these are audiophile headphones - you "could" take these to the gym, but they don't feel like they could take a work out or be durable over time.Updated: after a few weeks, I would still say that these are the most impressive pair of noise cancelling, bluetooth headphones I have owned in this price range. The only next step up would be Focal Bathys or Focal Celestee, which go for $800 and $1000 respectively. I think these would be comparable to Focal Elegia. Enjoy, these are the poor-man-audiophiles dream ;)
