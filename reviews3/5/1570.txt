Like with all other products, you have to know what you're getting and if it is the right thing for what you need to do. This isn't something to use for resource heavy gaming. On my computer, I use my built in HDMI port for gaming. This is used to extend my desktop for other things, such was viewing system resources and monitoring communications while I am playing.That being said, the picture quality, if you're just doing things like web surfing, using photoshop or even streaming Netflix in 1080 resolution, is great. Performing regular tasks like that, you can't see any difference between this and your built-in HDMI port. However, you HAVE to use a USB 3.0 or better port to get good results. I am using a USB C 3.1 port and two 1080p monitors with this and have no issues at all.Be sure that your system automatically installs the drivers from Windows Update or that you go to the StarTech website and manually install the driver form there. This will not work if you don't do one of those. After the driver installs, leave the adapter plugged into your USB port and reboot your system. For me, the screens attached to this come up as fast as the built in screen on my laptop after doing all the appropriate set up.Bottom line, this isn't a built in video card and it is not a high priced PCIe video card. If you don't try to treat it as such and know how work within its limitations, then things will go smoothly.
