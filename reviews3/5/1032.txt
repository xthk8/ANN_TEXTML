I’ve had this for almost a year now and it’s still working great. Charges my phone like no other. The cord is long so it’s very convenient when you wanna lay down in bed while it’s charging, very convenient! The cable is very sturdy too so you don’t have to worry if it’s bent and then not work anymore. I no longer uses a regular iPhone charger anymore. Seriously, this has made me a lifetime customer!
