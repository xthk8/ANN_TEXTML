The USB-c connection on my laptop does not support video output. Therefore, it can only support natively one external monitor via HDMI port. However, I do need to have 2 external monitors connected. After searching for information on the internet, this product was the result of the search.Long story short, it works right out of the box. I tested by connecting it to a TV. No need to download any driver. It took the devices half a minute or so to recognize and display image on the screen. Windows also recognizes the second screen and everything works as they should. Quality is no different from connecting it via HDMI port, even though it is not sold as a dedicated video card. I am not a gamer, so I have no idea about frame rate, etc.It solves a serious shortcoming of this laptop computer, which is otherwise fantastic. Highly recommended, especially factoring in the cost, if you are in a similar situation.
