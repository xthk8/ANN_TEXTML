They don't sound like really expensive phones, they are a bit lacking in their cord length, but here is the thing, they sound sufficient for casual listening and the cord is long enough if you are at your computer. Their strength is this. I have never seen an inexpensive set of head phones anywhere near this comfortable. If you are going to sit at your computer and watch something like a downloaded movie they are perfect...for less than $10! I never thought I'd see the day. I have a couple of phones costing nearly 10 times this much in my main stereo system, and these are nearly as comfortable. For what they are designed for they are just an exceptional bargain.
