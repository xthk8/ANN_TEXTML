This is a 512GB MicroSD with rated speeds up to 160 MB/s Read and 90 MB/s Write. If you pair it with a $10 Kingston MobileLite Plus USB 3.2 UHS-II MicroUSD card reader, you will achieve the read/write speeds shown in the image. Don't use the adapter that comes with the card. Shame on SanDisk for including a slow adapter.
