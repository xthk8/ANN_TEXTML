The product was easy to install. Good snug grip on the cars A/C vent. Adjusted to viewing angle with no problem. I only rated it with 4 stars due to the adhesive used on the metal plates that attach to the phone or phone case is sub standard for the type of application. The PVC phone case was cleaned and dried with rubbing alcohol prior to placing the adhesive side of the metal plate on the phones pvc case. Even with pressure applied the adhesive would not stick. Repeated the process again but this time directly on the phone backing with a different metal plate that was supplied. Again adhesive would not stick. So trying again roughed up the pvc case surface with corse grit sandpaper. Cleaned it. Applied silicone contact adhesive to both surfaces allowed to dry to a tacky touch then pressed the case and metal plate together let it sit for 8 hours to cure. A has held with no problem ever since even in the direct sun and humid climate weâ€™re I live.
