The Uniden R-7 Radar Detector Rocks! So much better than my 3 yr old detector (Not Uniden). I ran both side by side a few days and the R7 consistently out performed my old detector. The R7 is twice as sensitive in picking up Ka band radars. Customizing the bands for sensitivity is a great feature and knocks out false alarms that had my old unit screaming. Very sharp display along with directional arrows indicating the radars direction is a big plus! Looking forward to many years of flawless operation. Highly recommend this to anyone serious about detecting radars at insane distances.
