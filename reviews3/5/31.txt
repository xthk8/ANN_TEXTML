I bought these chargers during the Black Friday sale and I’m happy with my purchase it charges your iPhone very fast and it’s a good quality charger. Just note that don’t bend the charger a lot because it will make the charger go bad, just take care of it and you’ll have no problems with the charger. And if anything does go wrong you have 2 other chargers. Just treat your charger right and it will last and charge your phone in a matter of minutes. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
