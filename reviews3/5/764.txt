If you’re an indie filmmaker, if you do live stream, if you make any kind of content for YouTube on a smartphone, you need this. The learning curve with the app is fairly short, the different settings do require some practice, but this rivals far more expensive steadicam rigs. Compact, it really will fit in a cargo pants pocket, and works with heavier/larger phones than previous models. I’ll be using this for a short film I wrote, and I know it will give the project very high production value.
