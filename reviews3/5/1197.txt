I've been buying anchor earbuds for the better part of 6 years now.Owned basically all sound core ear buds.Liberty 2Liberty 2 proLiberty 2 pro upgradedLiberty 3Love A1A40 (still my all time fav, just missing ANC. but best fit and sound)I was very excited about these earbuds when they are announced especially for the priceI've had a couple different Samsung earbuds and a couple different beats and both of them are pure flat-out garbage especially for the priceWhat I really like about these ones is their touch but it's not overly sensitive like the Galaxy buds to where you can actually adjust them in your ear without skipping 17 tracks and adjusting the volume in one motionThe app is amazing with these earbuds more so than the other earbuds that I've had that use the appThe noise cancellations is borderline flawless and I'm around heavy machinery all day and have no issues listening to my podcast even with one bud in.Transparency mode is phenomenal. That might be my favorite thing from when I go out on my bike rides I can still hear the traffic and everything going on around me and it doesn't interfere with what I'm listening to one bitIf you're looking for earbuds let me be the only person who influences youBUY THESE!!!And if you don't like them after a week or two you can return them with no issue.The only flaw that I have with these budsAnd it drives me crazyThey need wings. Sometimes they do start slipping out after being in for awhile.It's what I loved so much about the A40sThey fit sooooooo well with the wings and never irritate my ears like other winged earbuds
