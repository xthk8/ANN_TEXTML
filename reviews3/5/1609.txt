Once size fits all....what's not to likeRecently I traveled internationally and used this power charger to power my devices when needed. My laptop (rated 65 w max), Iphone, airpods etc. 2 cables (USB C to lightning for iphone and airpods) and USB C to USB C for my laptop. So much easier traveling with one small power source v's 2 and usually the laptop one is so much bigger.
