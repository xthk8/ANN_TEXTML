The cord length is the perfect length in my opinion especially when you have to use an outlet that is further away. It also charges my phone incredibly fast in comparison to the regular Apple charger I was using before, this charger is a definite game changer! I havenâ€™t had it long enough to really say much about the durability but so far so good. Would recommend!
