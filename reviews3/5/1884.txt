First I need to say this for all the people who shouldn’t have the right to reviewJUST BECAUSE YOU SEE ONE AND THE RADAR DETECTOR ISNT GOING OFF DOESNT MEAN THE DETECTOR DOESNT WORK.Its so frustrating when I’m driving with family and they see “them” and my dumb cousins like “ahh your detector doesn’t work trash $500 stupid” i wanna punch him so hard.No radar detector going off = no one is running radar nearby.. their job isn’t solely to detect speeders and their equipment is not always onThat one guy that left a 1 star with a video of him behind a cop w the radar quiet needs his video removed because he doesn’t understand this is a radar frequency detector, no frequency = no detection.VIRGINIA.. god awful state when it comes to speed limits. Jesus Christ. Always got my eyes peeled but now having 2 sets of eyes (Waze + R7) makes driving much more comfortable.If I wanna go, I can go, knowing that if someone is using laser / radar, I’ll see them before they see me , which isn’t true for other detectors.The quick connect makes it super easy to dismount when you see “them” .K 24.160 = hondas / Acura’sK 24.124 = MazdasK 24.110 = Sherrif(These are the only 3 K bands I’ve memorized this far)You’re 100% gonna have to tweak yours in the settings to fit your state. Both K & Ka are used by “them” so I have to run both, we dont use X band here so, I turned it off but thats simplified , there are YT videos and forums, read it.I’ve caught “them” so many times, easily saved me thousands when you count up how many instances / what the fines wouldve beenDon’t get the R3 and justify “oh it’s same I just cant see directional arrow” you’re gonna become a slave to the radar and everytime it goes off you’re paranoid bc you don’t know where it isEscort 360Max is another good option that might have more accuracy in some instances but it’s not a big enough difference to justify the short range and its not as difficult to detect like the R7.Also this just looks cooler
