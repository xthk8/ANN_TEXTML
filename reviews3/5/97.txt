I am the type of person who is always out of the house and I need to ensure that I have good chargers that work. I ordered these and they are actually perfect! I kept one at work, gave one to my family members, and keep one in my travel suitcase. I love the fact that they are the new USB Type C so they work with my new Macbook since my old ones did not. They are a good length and I would say to buy them.I just got these over a month ago so I cannot talk about the durability of the chargers just yet but they do not feel flimsy.
