Of all the headphones I have had, these are the most comfortable. I'm wearing them throughout my workday which is 9 hours, and very little discomfort has been had. I have no piercings so take that into consideration. These replaced my Beats Solo 3 which were so painful to wear, and the Bluetooth connection has also been better. The audio quality is great for what I want which is just listening to music, audiobooks, and YouTube. These feel like a steal honestly.
