I can’t go without having a pop socket on my phone. It helps me with fidgeting & im constantly messing around with it. I also use it a lot as a stand for my phone to watch videos either when I’m eating (I live alone and it feels weird to eat by myself probs another adhd thing I always have to be doing something), on a plane, or even when I’m doing my makeup or hair in the morning. Only the actual pop socket brand lasts as far as adhesion & feels sturdy. It also isn’t super stiff when you pull it up like the off brand ones are. I really like the clear one too because it goes with a lot of different phone cases :)
