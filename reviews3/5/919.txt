I mounted a 32" tv to the wall with this mount and it really feels like a quality mount. Instructions are clear and easy to follow and it comes with a lot of extra hardware. The only thing I would caution is that if you really want something that puts the tv very close to the wall, there may be others out there that are better suited for this purpose. In making that change, you would probably give up some range of motion though. I would buy it again if it met my needs for where I would be placing a TV.
