I have had this for about a week and am really loving it. I travel a great deal for work and wanted something to keep my GPS handy that was handsfree. This meets that need and works really well. It sticks very strongly to the magnetic holder and is easy to take on and off. The holder was adjustable to fit my vehicleâ€™s air vent. The only negative I have found so far is that you cannot use heat from your regular vents when using this or your phone will overheat. I learned this the hard way. You have to put heat on defrost so it does not blow directly on the phone. Great buy. Would purchase again. It is so convenient!
