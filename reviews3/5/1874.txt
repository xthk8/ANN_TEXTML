Had for about 8 months. Important to understand how it works. I have gotten pulled over 2x with it, cause they weren’t running radar. It does work great when they are using radar. Ie; it beeps a weak signal.. driving 60mph.. then gets stronger progressively and then a cop passes me on the opposite side, something I would not have seen until it’s tooLate and something that waze would not have reported since they’re moving. Or it picks up a cop a few cars behind. Directional arrows really help. For every ticket I might get I’ve probably avoided 7+ by running this. Get it if you have the $ for it
