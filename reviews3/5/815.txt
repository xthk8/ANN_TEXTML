I ordered two sets of these, one black, one blue, for myself and my wife for Christmas. We love them. We have used them for hours at a time, but have never run the batteries all the way down. They charge quickly in their case, which uses a USB-C cable like most newer Samsung phones (such as ours).I tested mine out for making cell phone calls, and was told my voice sounded loud and clear. You can use a single earbud at a time to double your usage time for calling, but I only use mine for private HD listening.The HD audio is great, and the noise cancelling works as well as our more expensive wired Dr. Dre and Skull Candy earphones. We would have used those forever, were it not for the lack of an AUX jack on our new Galaxy S22-Ultra phones. Given no real choice, we moved to these Bluetooth earbuds, and we are happy with them. I know that my kids can locate their high-dollar earbuds using their phones or a website, and can be alerted the moment they are synced with a thief's phone. These JBL buds offer none of those high-dollar features, and perhaps that's why they cost far less. As I mentioned, I don't notice any difference in the audio quality.My only fear is that what has happened to my kids will eventually happen to us--we will lose one or both. At least I'll be out only a fraction of the replacement cost for their AirPods.In short, the competitors' fancy tracking features are nice, but costly. If you don't need such features, then these JBLs are an awesome alternative.Hope this helps. Thanks for reading.
