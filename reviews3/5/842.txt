I purchased this as a gift for my parents and in-laws. They loved it!I’ll start by saying the picture quality was amazing!One of my favorite things about the product is that family members can download the app and upload pictures to the frame of their loved ones. Or email pictures to the email address established at setup if they don’t want to download the app.I purchased the product, downloaded the app and set up the frames with my information, uploaded pictures via the app (can download up to 50 at a time), and when the gift was given, transferred ownership of the frames to the recipients. Now with the ownership being transferred, I can still upload pictures to their frames from the app- I just can’t see pictures they have uploaded or others have uploaded/emailed to the frame.
