I was really skeptical that I could find a pair of earbuds I wouldn't be disappointed in. I own Sony headphones and am a musician, so my ears have high standards. I was amazed by the quality of these for the price, and happy I trusted the overwhelmingly positive reviews. The battery life is phenomenal as well. I've used them for almost two weeks and am just reaching my first charge. My pair also came with a lifetime warranty, but I don't know if they all do so please don't bank on that. It was just a positive in my specific case.Like some other headphones I've seen, I'm not leaving five-star reviews to get the coupon or for the warranty, or anything other than trying to help someone who may be as cautious as I was.I couldn't say more without being redundant. If you're hesitant and looking for confirmation, hopefully, you have to look no further to do so without doubts.
