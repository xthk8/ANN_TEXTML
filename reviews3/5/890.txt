Got 3 different types of cheap sets. Problems with sound quality, or hardware issues.Gave up and got these. The sound quality is great! People that say the cheap ones sound just as good are misjudging the quality.The case also let's you know when it needs charging. With the buds out of the case lifting the lid will give a green light, meaning it doesn't need charging, or an orange one meaning it does.I'm glad I spent the bucks on a good pair. Use it on my Samsung Galaxy A51 phone.
