I bought these a week ago and wanted to test the battery life before I wrote a review. They came completely charged which was a nice surprise. After 7 days of using them regularly, the battery life was only down to 42. They are comfortable and have good sounds quality but are not noise cancelling at all. They don’t claim to be, but just clarifying. The battery display on the front is nice so you’re not guessing when they might die on you. I sure did drop one in a running sink on day 2 and panicked but I was able to dry it off quickly and they seem to be working fine still. They don’t have great range as far as when you put your phone down and walk away. I’m terrible at guessing length so I’m not going to try but I’m able to walk around my house at least. When I walk outside they lose connection. I definitely recommend for the price.
