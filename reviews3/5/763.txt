I just use this product to capture my travels in Europe for the past four weeks. It gives you amazing flexibility and control over your iPhone for video. The video is stable, beautiful, and for the most part intuitive and easy to capture. There was a slight learning curve for a few features, but, having never read the manual, I did just fine and this product performed amazingly well. It also folds up really small so that it fits in a fanny pouch, which gives you easy access to it exactly when you need it battery life was never an issue. I believe this device took my video to the next level . The only thing I would add is next time I will bring a drone. Otherwise, this thing is perfect I love especially the magnetic camera mount and easy attachment and folding.
