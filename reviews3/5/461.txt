I've had the OfficeJetPro 276DW Printer/Scanner/Copier/Fax for as long as I've had the Dell 7910 Tower, and I only use HP cartridges. Good paper (at least 22 lb) helps a lot too. I just wish the HP software was as full featured with Windows Server as with other OSes. I know, not an Ink cartridge issue.
