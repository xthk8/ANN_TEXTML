My daughters has an older laptop, Acer Nitro 5 laptop which only has 1 hdmi port. The usb-c port on the laptop does not support display. So I went with this and at first it did not work. So I went to the website and downloaded the drivers, which were promising, but then still nothing? I was googling forums and everything to try and see what went wrong. Turns out there is ANOTHER driver software that is different but the correct one. I re-plugged in everything after restarting, waited about 30 seconds for it to think and BAM. So, its not entirely plug and play for this laptop, but if it doesn't work off the bat, don't give up.
