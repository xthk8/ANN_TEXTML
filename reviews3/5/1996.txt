I don’t really write reviews for things but these headphones are soooo good and so affordable! I did alot of research and was between the sony WH-CH710N’s and these. This one was the winner, they’re much better quality build/sound wise and are so so comfortable. One thing though is that, the sounds leaks but for the price, not complaining that much. All in all good purchase, and don’t have to worry too much about them too much because they’re not 150+.
