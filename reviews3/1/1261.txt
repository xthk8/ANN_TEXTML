I have had nothing but trouble with the ink I bought from Amazon. Finally gave up and threw it away with little to no use out of it. My printer refused to read it. I bought form Walmart, reads it fine and prints fine. I don't know if these are refurbished and not new? Maybe that is why. But a total waste of good money for me.
