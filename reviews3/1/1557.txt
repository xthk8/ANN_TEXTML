It isnâ€™t any easier for me to get a good seal with these than with the Apple tips that came with my AirPods 2, and these are very uncomfortable. The foam is very firm rather than soft & spongy and my ears were sore after wearing them for a short time. I went back to the original Apple tips. In both types I wear a medium in my left ear & a large in my right.
