I bought 2 of this item. At first they worked great. They charged all my different devises fast and without any issues. That lasted about 3 weeks. Then 1 of them started to not work at random times. It simply would not charge anything. My phone wouldn’t even register that a charger was plugged into it. The other one started to get hot (the piece that plugs into the phone) while charging.And seems to get more and more hot every time I use it. Seriously disappointing because they seemed like a great buy at first. But unfortunately they didn’t last long at all.Just long enough to pass the return period.I swear, companies that sell crap like this should get shut down for fraud.Whatever happened to being honest, having good manners and being considerate of others? People need to get back to the basics like; Do unto others as you’d have them do unto you.. and; Sticks and stones may break my bones but (your stupid) words can never hurt me. …I mean come on people.(Hard eye roll at the world)But back to the chargers..lolIf you need something that lasts a week, they’re great, otherwise don’t bother with them.
