The memory came out with problems, you can see the error on the dash cam and it cannot be formatted in Windows. I tried multiple ways and none of them worked.I took it out of its packaging, placed it in the camera and that was the bad news that I could seeI bought a memory of 32 but only 8 shows up. Can't format. It's a shame because I had great expectations of this memoryTotally dissapointed
