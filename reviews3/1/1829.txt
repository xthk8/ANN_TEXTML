I print in color relatively infrequently with this printer and yet the color ink cartridges seemed to always be out or low on ink. After reading a bit on the Brother website, it seems they have programmed their ink jet printers to only use a cartridge for a certain amount of time and then require they be changed. It's stated this is to preserve print quality, but it seems more likely it's to preserve their revenue stream. Unfortunately, my particular printer will not even allow me to print in black and white if a color cartridge is "empty" so I basically have to keep replacing the color cartridges, even if I don't use them. After several years of this, I'm done. Will not be continuing to pay for products I don't use and will be switching to another brand of printer when my existing cartridges expire or "run out of ink".
