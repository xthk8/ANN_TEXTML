How can this lamp be dead after two uses? Is it because it is inexpensive, so it must be a piece of junk? I have other lamps in the house - had them for years and they're fine - but they're too "big". I bought this for my wife to ease her vlogging process, and instead, it's become nothing but trouble. Won't turn on, even after an overnight charge. When it chooses to turn on, it gives you a very dim glow that remains unchanging even though you increase the brightness to the highest. The lowest beam used to be enough to light any scene. Now the highest is inadequate. If I remember distinctly, there used to be a light in the back that came on during the charging. It doesn't turn on anymore. Did I get a defective product, Ulanzi? That seems to be a thing on Amazon now. I'm so upset.
