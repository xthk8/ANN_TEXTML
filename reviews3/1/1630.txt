I bought this like a week ago. I went to the hospital last night and forgot about it and left it plugged in, not thinking it would cause any issues. I came out this morning and went to start my car only for it to be dead… before anyone wonders, I’ve never had that issue ( yes the highlights were off and so were inside lights. The plug in was all that was new. ) it’s not worth ur money when u get stranded.
