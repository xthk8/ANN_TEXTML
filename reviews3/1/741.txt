Wonderfully designed product that we used in our garage to charge our electric bikes and hoverboards.Unfortunately it died unexpectedly after about 3 weeks. We thought it was something else along our setup for a while but after testing all the pieces of our “charging station” it was proven this little guy just stopped working.It’s possible the unit we received was just a lemon but wanted to share so potential buyers are aware.
