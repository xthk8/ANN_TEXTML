The product didn’t come broken or anything. Once I started using it I’ve realized u can’t move the phone part down or up it stays straight. It also has these nudges u have to turn a lot for everytime u want to change something about the tripod. I got it for a cheap price and thought it was a steal now I’m gonna buy a new one. It’s not worth it. I didn’t like it. The Bluetooth is nice tho has a remote
