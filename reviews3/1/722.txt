I bought these because they seemed to be better than the other versions when comparing all of them together. Well I was wrong. Comfort level is very good, however they are a bit big so they don’t fit snug. The battery life is actually very very good. I was very pleased as well as impressed. But the volume no matter what I’m using to listen to music or watch a movie is terrible. It’s like it has one setting and that’s it. It doesn’t get very loud at all. I wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone.
