This review is based on my personal experience with the product which formed the opinion I will share here.Iâ€™ve purchased 2 sets of these (6 cords in all) since my whole household uses iPhones. The cords work great at first and appear and feel well made. However, after about a month, the crimping of the male connecter protective sheathing disconnects from the cord revealing the actual electrical wires (which are individually insulated and wrapped). I discard them at this point because I have safety concerns when they are in that condition. I will not purchase these again.
