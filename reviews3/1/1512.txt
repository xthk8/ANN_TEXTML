The reason I wanted this was so I could use cellular data instead of Wi-Fi to watch movies/shows. My Wi-Fi at my house is limited due to satellite so needed to be able to watch stuff using my unlimited cellular data.But T his does not work on most apps. I tried Netflix, Disney+, HBO, HULU. It mirrors the phone well, opens the apps from the phone onto the TV but does not play the movie/show from that app. I did get it to play episodes of Yellowstone from the Paramount Network app and it had a great clear picture, I was able to pause and stuff from my watch which was nice. I ended up returning this and spending $49 on the actual Apple adapter and it works on all the apps no problem.
