Was disappointed in this product. Had a lot of good reviews and wanted to bring it for my International trip because it's so small and compact. It was very disappointing that it didn't work. I have the first Apple Watch so it COULD BE that it isn't compatible with mine. However, I did test it before the trip and it worked. Once I got over there - no. The watch would just get incredibly hot. I tried using it through a USB on the wall AND via my laptop. Not sure - maybe I just got a faulty one but for me, not worth it.
