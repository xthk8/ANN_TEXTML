Early last month I ordered a pair of these earbuds and they arrived broken. You would think that for $150 they would work. The right earbud would connect fine, but the left one would die the moment you took it out of the case. I attempted every problem-solving method, but nothing worked. Inevitably, I paid for mailing and returned the earbuds. I then attempted to buy another pair just for the package to be "undeliverable" and now I have no earbuds and I am extremely disappointed. I do not recommend this product to anybody, as a matter of fact, I actively discourage it, the risk is not worth the reward and the company does not care about the products or the customers.
