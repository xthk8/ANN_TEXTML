I bought this after having no luck with cheap USB microphones. I liked the idea that I could upgrade to XLR when I could afford an audio interface. Imagine my immense disappointment when the sound quality on this microphone was just as bad as the cheap USB microphones I had tried. I really tried to get the sound to work, for almost a month, but it just wasn't working. And I'm not even doing this for something that will make me money, just a hobby. I was so aggravated that I broke down and got a mid range audio interface. Hooked it up to this mic and... nothing. It's possible that this was the fault of the audio interface, but at that point it was just about the end of the return period so I just returned it since I didn't have time to troubleshoot and I knew it was useless as a USB microphone. The direct monitoring didn't work either, so maybe I just got a dud? It is true that I have trouble with mouth noises and need to be further away from the mic (6" at least). So if you have a voice where you could speak right into the microphone, and I mean right on top of it, then maybe you'll get as good results as everybody else seems to. But for me it was useless.
