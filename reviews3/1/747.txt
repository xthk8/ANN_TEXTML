For a while I thought it was my phone's lightning port that broke. None of the cables in this purchase -- while they were fine at first -- are reliable anymore. Since multiple cables weren't working, it seemed it had to be the phone.But I finally tested official Apple Lightning cables on the phone, and they work just fine. These lightning cables have a lot of play after being connected, and if the phone is disturbed at all the phone stops charging.These are not recommended and should be replaced.
