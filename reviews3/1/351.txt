Anker have recently shown themselves to be unworthy of your trust. Their sub-brand, Eufy, sold security cameras with the outright false claim that your footage is stored locally and that you do not need to worry about leakage of your sensitive footage through cloud services.You can now find news stories about how that claim was not only false, but that they also left vulnerabilities in their cloud service that do expose your footage to attackers. Their own privacy policy even contradicted their marketing claims.Please vote with your wallets and show them that this deceit comes at a cost.
