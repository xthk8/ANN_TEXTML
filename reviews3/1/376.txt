I’ve had these bands for two months, and I’ve worn the black one nearly every day. I pull it on once in the morning, pull it off once at night, and I have a gentle hand. Today when I moved to pull my Watch on, the band’s bottom snap-in handle broke, and sent my Watch down three feet onto the kitchen tile, shattering it and leaving it completely unusable.I bought these bands loving the price point for so many color options and highly-rated reviews, but I got what I paid for. The snap-in handles are SO flimsy. I’ve purchased similarly priced bands from other brands here on Amazon and never had a similar problem. These are absolutely not made to last and could land you in a situation like mine in a flash. Now I have to spend hundreds of dollars to repair or replace my Watch. :’-(Please be extra, super, unbelievably careful when considering purchasing these bands, and using them if you already own them. Check your handles for signs of wear or cracking!
