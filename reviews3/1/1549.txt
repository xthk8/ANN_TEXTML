I was very surprised at the poor quality of this cover. Was planning to use this to cover an Anker extension power strip. However once installed, the cover did not lay flat. Gave it a couple days to let it settle, but no difference. Compared to other covers I have, it feels very thin and cheap. I would not recommend. It is a shame since the gray was exactly the color I was hoping for.
