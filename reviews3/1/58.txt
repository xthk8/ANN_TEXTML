When I originally bought this item, it was listed as a 1Tb SD card, that I bought for my Nintendo Switch. I knew it was too good to be true for the price, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and bought it. Surprise! Corrupt data! Immediately I tried troubleshooting it myself, thankfully I didn't lose or corrupt any other data once the SD card was removed. I did several tests, and always got a corrupt error.When I went back to check the reviews (Mind you - When initially bought, the item page had *actual* reviews for the SD card, and they were decent) to see if anyone else had this problem too, and was met with SAW BLADE reviews. Contacted Amazon. During the chat, the page had NO REVIEWS, and the "Questions" portion were equally confused - Is this a Saw? Is this an SD card? As of 5/16, it's back to saw blade reviews. A replacement SD card is on the way, but I don't have high hopes of that working, either, but will update the review as necessary. Don't risk it, find a better SD card.EDIT: Both cards don't work. Don't waste your time. Product reviews show Saw Blade, SD Card, and Five Nights At Freddy's toys that are also all broken. Seller changed their business/sales name, as well.
