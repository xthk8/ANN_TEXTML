Note that you have to use a magsafe phone case in order to use this mount. Even your phone is magsafe compatible (Iphone 12/13 etc). Because this won't work with a normal case and the suction power is weak. Even when you don't use a phone case, it still comes off during bumpy rides. I bought an Iphone 12 pro max leather case from Apple just to use this mount. it's better because the leather makes the phone not as slippery compared with using bare phone without a case. I do not recommend especially for a price tag of $40. It's a NO from me.
