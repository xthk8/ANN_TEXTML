Bought a brand new Brother HLL6200DW printer less than a year ago. When the starter cartridge ran low on toner I replaced it with this TN880 genuine Brother cartridge. From day one it leaked toner and gave me dirty prints. Followed Brothers instructions for cleaning the system and then instructions for decreasing the density of the print to correct the problem. Nothing worked. Brother advised that I needed to replace the cartridge and possibly the drum as well both at my expense. The toner cartridge has less than 200 pages on it and the drum less than 3200 pages. I told them the printer itself was still under warranty and I could buy a new printer for less than the cost of a new drum and toner cartridge combined. They said they would send me a new toner cartridge but have not received as of this posting. Since I have seen at least one other post for excess toner with this cartridge I think they may have a quality control issue with some of these units so I do not recommend them as a replacement.
