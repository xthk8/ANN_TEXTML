Within minutes of receiving the selfie stick, I took it out to try it. The remote easily paired with my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 8) and worked perfectly.What didn't work was when I attempted to mount the phone portrait orientation. I opened up the phone "holder" by loosening the screw. As I tried to tighten the screw back down once my phone was in, the knob fell off of the screw post. This means you literally cannot tighten the "holder" onto the phone. In addition, you have to put it at the very bottom of the phone for it to fit on top of the selfie stick itself due to the size of the base.The screw that attaches the phone holder to the base also does not tighten completely. You can get it into the phone holder fine, but then the entire phone just spins around after that as there is no way to stop that disc from turning.I spent way too much time researching the best selfie stick to end up with this dud.
