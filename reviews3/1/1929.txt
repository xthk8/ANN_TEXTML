This is the most flimsy thing I’ve ever dealt with. It gets tall which is nice, the lights are bright. But the attached for your phone are super confusing. No matter how tight you tighten the thing, it’ll still find a way to fall over. It’s top heavy too, so if you plan on using your phone make sure it’s not to the highest length. It will fall. I’m returning. I personally don’t even feel like it’s worth what they’re listing it as.
