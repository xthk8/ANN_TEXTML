I've ordered this ink 3 times. the first 2 times , no problem. The 3rd time my printer stopped printing because the magenta ink was empty. I bought and installed all the inks in the package at the same time. The cyan, yellow and black inks* were fine. (*The black ink came in a separate package than the other 3 inks.) The printer won't work unless all the ink cartridges are full. So until the magenta ink cartridge is replaced my family and I are without a printer ! Part 2: Weeks later . . . . still no printer. Amazon was nice enough to reimburse us for â…“ of the cost of the ink. I was referred to Brother for a replacement. I was asked quite a few questions to prove I have a brother printer and grudgingly was toldthat I would be sent areplacement cartridge of the magenta. They said it was shipped via UPS, but I think someone is walking with it to my house because it's still not here and without it my printer won't work even if I only want toprint with black ink. From now on, I will not be buying ink on line from Amazon, although Amazon is not the problem. My guess is that ink sales don't move that quickly and the cartridges dry up or Brother is sending out poor quality ink. i will be buying ink from office supply stores where the product moves more quickly. Based on this experience, DO NOT BUY BROTHER INK from online vendors.
