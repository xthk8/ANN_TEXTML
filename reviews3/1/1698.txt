Sound quality is good, but noise levels are so terrible that it ultimately cancels out. At max volume these are still quieter than my $20 earbuds at half volume. Noise cancellation is subpar compared to other earbuds I've sampled.Battery life is a complete joke, I'm lucky to get through my 5 hour Zoom class without them giving out. Again, my $20 earbuds will last an entire 8 hour shift at work.They are very comfortable, however, that's the only good thing I have to say about them. Save your money and buy literally anything else, there's no excuse for these or their pricetag.
