Instructions are complicated. Spent 3 hours then returned back item. Could not figure which is left or right side. Tried both ways. It is advertised as installable in 10 minutes. I only ordered it as it was rated as amazon stellar, I will not trust that anymore. Will doubt it will work for 55 inch tv. I was trying to put in 24 inch long old table. Donâ€™t think it will fit but I never could do install. Will buy some thing that has no skewed legs or just a center post.
