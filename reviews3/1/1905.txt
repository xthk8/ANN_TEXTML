So I purchased this cable because it specifically advertised to work with 4K 120hz, I needed something to run from my 4090 to my TV, So since it was cheap and had good reviews I purchased it. Got the cable and my first impressions were it was good and looked high quality, this is all the pros. Connecting the cable and setting it up with my PC was going great until I started to get flashing on the screen, I restarted the PC, and TV and even checked the cable and it would flash every 5 seconds or lose signal completely, after going back and forth and checking settings it appears this cable only supports 4K 120hz for the cables smaller than 10ft, Yet the listing at the very top advertising it supports it and only if you scroll at the very bottom of the listing after you choose the length of the cable does it advertise the cable has to be shorter than 10ft and even then it's after the advertises the listing supports 4K 120hz.Due to these deceptive practices, I highly recommend looking at a different cable. A lot of people may purchase this cable to future-proof their setups where they may be getting a new game console or better GPU that will take advantage of the 4K 120hz only to find out this cable just doesn't support it.
