First time I plugged it in it was audio only, unplugged and replugged and it came on. It worked good for a couple minutes until I tried a video appâ€¦ IT DOESNT WORK WITH STREAMING SERVICES!!! Decided oh well Iâ€™ll still use it for other things and then back to audio only. There is an app you can download that is supposed to help but itâ€™s sketchy looking and I didnâ€™t trust it. BTW the Apple AppStore reviews for this thing say itâ€™s dog ðŸ’©.
