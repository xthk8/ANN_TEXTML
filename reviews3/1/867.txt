First off, they are VERY finicky to turn on. One side, I can tap and it turns on. The other, I have to touch it in a specific place for what seems like over a minute. They do not cancel out much noise at all. I turn my phone up to 100% and it sounds like it's on 20%. Very disappointed. I prefer my Skull Candy Sesh Evo ear buds.
