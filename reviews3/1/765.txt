Cord was shorting out and burning wires. It was not damaged until it started burning and melting rubber. I have a claim in with Amazon that is taking weeks to get settled. I’m very frustrated but glad it didn’t start a deadly fire.Update review 6/8/2020I feel I must add to this review. I have sent a message to the claims department for Amazon Sedgwick.com to the Attn of the adjuster handling my claim because I am very disturbed after reading reviews today where there are other claims of overheating and fire danger from these chargers. When I first spoke to Amazon I was under the impression that Amazon would be suspending sales of this item until a safety investigation could be conducted. It does not appear this has happened. At 75 years old the fact that this charger was in the process of starting a fire on my bed is extremely frightening to me. If it has happened a few hours later I would have been in my bed asleep. As it happened I had walked into my room and smelt burning rubber and found it burning into my comforter. It was not connected to my phone, it was connected to my charging station.PLEASE DO NO BUY THESE CHARGERS. I AM VERY CONCERNED THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF SERIOUS IF NOT DEADLY FIRE. I want this document made public in the event there is an investigation into this product.
