Item stopped working after less than 6 weeks. I have owned over a dozen surge protectors in the last few decades--never has one stoped working--this is unheard of for such an item. And I am not the only one. But only 7 others?? Are people afraid to report such failures? If you choose to buy this item, please report a failure if it occurs to protect other buyers. I do not understand why this item has a 4.7 rating. I am extremely disappointed. The concept is excellent, but surge protectors just don't stop working.
