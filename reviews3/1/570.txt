I'm using a gen 4 iPad pro with an apple pencil gen 2 (all updated). It started out fine, but a few hours in it wouldn't produce a line, then it would do uneven lines and blotches. I adjusted the nib by removing it and putting it back on but it didn't help. I used a two finger glove but it didn't help. What works is if I draw with the apple pencil straight down. At any slightest angle it would glitch. I bought a 2 pack and the second tip seems to be doing fine. I'm going to return it because of the defect.
