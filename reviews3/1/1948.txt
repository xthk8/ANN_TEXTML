Well, the negative reviews were right after all. This power strip just died for no reason after less than 3 months of use. A big, fat waste of money. I should have paid attention to the reviews and saved myself the money and hassle.Original Review:I was a little worried when I read the scary bad reviews about this surge protector. Still, I liked the option of a longer cord (I got an 8 foot one.) and the six outlets with a lighted turn on/off switch. I have had no problems at all with this strip. All things plug in securely and everything works as it should. The strip doesn't get hot when in use, even when fully loaded. I have only had it for about a month so I can't attest to the longevity of it. I removed a star for now because, even though the surge protector is working perfectly for me right now, it's important to know how it will hold up over time.I will update in a few months and, if it is still working as it should, add the last star. Naturally, if I have an issue with the surge protector, I will come back and let you know. For now, I am very happy with it and have no issues with it at all.
