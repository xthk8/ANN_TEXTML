I got this tower to save some space when it comes to cables. Now i dont put a lot of stuff on it, i usually have my phone charging, a table lamp and s wired phone. And one night this thing make some sound like something poped inside. Never went working again, and i wouldnt have used it even if it did. Luckly it was only the table lamp plugged in at that time and nothing happened to it. I dont know how this is supposed to have surge protection because apparently it doesnt. I guess looks are not everything...do urself a favor and buy a nice cord from a brand name that actually will protect ur items.
