I ordered these headphones out of concern for the potential long-term ramifications of wireless headphone usage. I used these a few times for an hour or two each time upon receipt without particular concern. Was the quality on par with my AirPods? No, but thatâ€™s ok.Imagine my surprise when, after 20 minutes of use this evening, both sides started to snap and crackle, burning my ears!!I purchased these to be SAFER. Now I am way too fearful to even think of using them again. Hopefully I can return.
