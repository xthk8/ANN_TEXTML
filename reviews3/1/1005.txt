I bought original HP tri-color ink and black HP61 for my HP Envy 4501. It says that the cartridge is not compatible but the black works great. I unplugged the printer, reinstalled, updated drivers, cleaned connections, etc. I’ve tried everything that I know to make it work. I reinstalled the OLD color cartridge and it’s working fine though almost empty. Amazon supplied me with a phone number that wouldn't work so I sent email that was directed to India and they gave me 2 more numbers and 1 of those was scam selling insurance and the other was no longer in use. They said I could chat with someone but I had to download a Whatsapp to do that. I give up and requested to return to Amazon. I will be buying anything BUT HP from now on.
