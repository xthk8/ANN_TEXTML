I bought these 2 chargers. While I was in the hotel I charging my phone I smelt funny smell. The good thing was that the phone was next to my bed side stand. I touched the charger and felt it was very hot. My phone stopped charging. I thought it was an issue with the power outlet. I decided to use another charger that came with my phone. It worked fine. When I got to my desitination, I took this charger to use but strange enough I saw it was deformed (the pastic was melting). I told myself that mybe it was just a faulty one. Few days later I decided to use the next one. This time the phone was a little further from me. When I woke up, I found that my phone never charged. Because of the experience with the first one, I checked the second one and funny enough it showed signs of melting.I could say a lot but this one is a bad fake engineering work. Just do not buy or it will burn your house. Don't be fooled by the parkaging. It is junk. Just a quick note I am a chemical and mfg engineer. I know what I am talking about.
