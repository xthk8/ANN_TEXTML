This the worst Amazon purchase . I was sent missing accessories item. When I try to return offered replacement. It turnout replacement wasn’t even working. When I return I got charged restore fee. I will not buy another from this seller. Worst service !!!People were not able to hear me clearly and couldn’t provide inputs to my team on the meetings. Very bad experience both with product and seller
