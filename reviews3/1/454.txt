These are the worst thermal pouches I’ve ever bought. It ruined two pages of my 1st graders family time line that we want to keep. The sheets are much thinner and have a weird feel to them. The pages bubbled up and completely didn’t stick in other areas. On one page there were bubbles stretching and pulling across the entire page. In places it looks like there is plastic wrap covering the project. I ran out of my normal 3mill sheets that I used on my daughters project as well. There were no problems. I’m very disappointed. Not sure why there were so many positive reviews. I’d give them no stars if possible.
