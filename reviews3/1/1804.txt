The USB plug-in side was so stiff plugging it in that it damaged the USB receptacle in my brand new vehicle. Fortunately my warranty will cover the damage to my car. The gage metal thatâ€™s used is thicker than that of an Apple USB cable which is no doubt why it was so stiff plugging it in. These are very crudely made poor quality devices.
