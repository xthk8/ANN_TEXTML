I really loved this headset for the comfort and noise canceling but the first pair I owned broke at the pivot where the ear piece with mic connects to the headband. Cannot use at all with this break and you cannot fix it. I thought it was a fluke so I bought another pair. In less than 18 months the 2nd pair broke in the same exact place. I’ve see other reviews with the same issue, so there is a design flaw here. For this price, I’d expect these to last 3-5 years. Very disappointed.
