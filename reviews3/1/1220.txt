Product seems defective in 4630 office jet printer. I opened it up and tried it. Printer did not like it.Printer just says ink cartridge problem. (This type of problem defies explanation of why). Other small version hp 61 cartridges work fine. (Printer seems fine with smaller tricolor packs). When used, the smaller packs say depleted when empty. Other people, have same issue on hp support page. Phone support was too busy to take call.Other notes, the Ink cartridge, I purchased here, goes back and forth when opened, but does not print. Says message above. Ink cartridge is heavy with ink, so not depleted. I guess it is a manufacturer issue of some sort. I will check and see if my brother has a different printer type that can use it.
