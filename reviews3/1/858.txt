There wasn't a review that summed it simply like this so I would have made a better decision:- No Bass. To me it's useless. Too much treble gives me a headache can't hear beats.- Tozo app doesn't support / detect / connect to this model. What's the app for?- No noise cancellation.- If you put a larger cap (included several) and push it uncomfortably deep into the ear you you can hear less outside noise and then you can hear some beats, but still not enough bass like earbuds should be.- Only positive is design and fitment.
