After my old pair of earbuds died, I read all the good reviews about this, and decided to buy it. DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE. Here are 5 reasons why these suck:(1) NO BASS - the sound is light and tinny, and sounds awful compared to other wireless earbuds.(2) NO HAPTICS - to play/pause, adjust volume, etc. you simply touch it like you would an iPhone screen. No button, no haptics at all, the result being that in taking them in/out or adjusting them, you will inadvertently trigger the sensor, causing the audio to stop. This happens without fail every time, and is incredibly annoying.(3) NO SOUND BLOCKING - I can hear everything going on around me - conversations, background noise, etc. - even with them pushed fully into the ear with the largest ear inserts, and the volume turned up. Makes for a terrible audio experience.(4) POOR DESIGN - aside from the haptics, these are so flat in their design that taking them out of your ears is awkward. You really have to get your fingers wedged in your ears, which, of course, causes the play/pause sensor to be triggered. Very irritating.(5) UNCOMFORTABLE - The little rubber ear inserts - even the largest ones it comes with - are an absolute joke. They're tiny, hard, and inflexible, and they constantly feel like they're about to fall out.So, BE WARNED. There are much better wireless earbuds out there.
