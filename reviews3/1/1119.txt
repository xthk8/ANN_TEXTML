I used this in a multiple monitor setup and the driver quality is extremely poor as is evidenced in the driver installation which is messy/convoluted in the way its installed via exe since it doesn't use a standard driver, but the worst part is that because of the poor driver quality the image/video that is rendered is delayed by roughly 1/8th of a second or so if I had to guess to include mouse lag, video lag, and input/typing lag. In comparing monitors side by side (one directly connected to the GPU, the other connected by the USB to HDMI being reviewed) it was clear that the one connected directly via GPU had better responsiveness and quality in terms of mouse/page scrolling, video display, and typing/input responsiveness display. In any kind of screen transition state (closing applications, videos playing, video games) the adapter performs poorly and should not be used.I could see this potentially causing vision issues or headaches for some, I would strongly advise against buying this product.
