I bought these cables for one reason: to connect my iPhone to my car so that I can use the CarPlay features on the car console. I was bitterly disappointed to learn that the chip in these cables only supports charging, that my car cannot negotiate a connection with my iPhone required to support CarPlay.These cables are apparently only for charging, so be aware of that if you intend to use for any other purpose.Every couple years I make this mistake, telling myself that the shiny, low-priced cables are as good as the higher priced ones, and invariably this happens and I regret my decision. If all you need is a cable to charge your Apple devices this will probably serve you well. Otherwise, do yourself a favor, spend a little more on a better cable and get something that you know will work in situations. Anker brand cables have proven very reliable and last a year or better under moderate to heavy use.
