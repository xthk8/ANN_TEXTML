Product wouldn't charge in the included charging box.I bought the slightly more expensive "5200-UC" version (vs the simple 5200) because the "UC" version has a charging box that is a combination storage box and charging battery that would itself hold an additional 14hrs of charge that could be used as a small battery pack for the device. But it would never charge device (either nestled inside, or using the external stand).Additionally, about 20% of the time, the on/off slider wouldn't turn the device on. I'd have to turn the slide to the off position and turn it back "on" in order for it to actually turn on.Sure seems like it might have been a counterfeit: a brand new, $100 device shouldn't have two major malfunctions to different parts.Update: returned first purchase, and ordered a second. The second one is no better than the first. You will never convince me this is an authentic Plantronics headset. I've had the Plantronics Legend in the past, and it worked way more consistently than this shoddy product. The on/off button only turns the product on about 1/3rd of the time. I'm not told how many hours of charge I have, nor am i told that my bluetooth connection has been made. If I was Amazon, I'd be embarrassed that I was allowing somebody to sell bogus plantronics equipment.
