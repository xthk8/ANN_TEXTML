It does not fit in every cup holder even with the adjustable option as describedâ€¦it is too small. I have had mine for a couple of months now, and the ball the phone holder is attached to no longer in place. I have an iPhone, so it is nothing unusual. The phone just flops around in any direction it would like as I am driving. I would not recommend.
