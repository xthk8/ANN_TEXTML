So I bought these hoping they would be as good and still as accurate as the OG Tip. Turns out there not even close and have a noticeable wobble when drawing unlike the straighter lines with the OG tip. Added with this theres also a noticeable gap which makes me little worried and concerned when I put them on. I dont wanna try and froce it to screw on tighter especially well the og one just simply goes on and has a almost seamless look. Do wish I could get a refund or even send them back for a refund. Being I definitely won't be using these.Over all. Dont recommend.
