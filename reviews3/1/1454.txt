Trash. Returned. Started acting up the second time I used them when on a walk. The sound would automatically start turning down until it was at 0...I would increase it back up, and it would just decrease again to 0. I've seen headphones start to do that when they are old and need replacing, but not the SECOND time using them (on just casual strolls).
