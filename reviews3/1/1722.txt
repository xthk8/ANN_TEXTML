I got the Brother brand instead of the generic bc I am willing to pay extra for quality. So far I am extremely disappointed. The tape jams in my printer every single time I use it. I ironed a few onto my kids pool towels this morning but some of the corners look like they might peel off.Update: every single tag fell off after the first use. What a waste of money.
