Really wanted this to work for me. I use white noise to help me sleep so i was planning on wearing this while i slept. The first night i put it on and i woke up around 1am with a blistering headache. I had to immediately take it off and tried to go back to sleep unsuccessfully. Got up the next day and i had a red pressure mark on my forehead right where the volume controls sat on it. I dont have a oddly or excessively large head its just that the controls are flat hard plastic with no padding behind them. They have also placed them on the most curved part of your skull. I even tried to wear this backwards and it just moved my headache to the back of my head. If they make another model with the controls on the side i would definitely try them. I dont have hair for padding and dont see how anyone can wear these and be comfortable. Returned for refund.
