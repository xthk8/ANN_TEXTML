I ordered this item for our receptionist so she would be able to move around the office and answer calls at the same time. According to the picture it has 3 different options to have the head set on , it also vagally states this in the description. what we received was not what is pictured and mentioned in the description. In short we are not pleased with what we had purchased as we now have to buy another 2 parts to make it work. I reached out to ask about it and they said it is not included. in the future we will be looking else where.
