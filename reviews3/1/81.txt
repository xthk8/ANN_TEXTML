When I unpacked it from it's shipping container my first impression was how light and cheaply made it is. All parts are flimsy plastic. I put fresh batteries in it and tried out in my large fish tank before I took it out to the lake I was not impressed at all and was convinced that it probably was going to preform very poorly. To say I was right is an understatement.Weather conditions today are perfect for ice fishing 40F and I use a tent so no wind I drilled an 8" hole put in fresh batteries again (thought maybe the ones I put in first could be old even though I took them right out of the package) Ice was about 8" or so thick and 10' of water Set it up perfect and hung the camera underneath. IT TURNED ONCE AND DIED The cheap motor in this POS is simply not strong enough to turn the weight of the camera dangling from it Can't say it any plainer than that. Remove the camera and it turns Very poorly engineered and very cheap materials Again DO NOT BUY You will be very disappointed TYPS Wouldn't even have given it 1 star But can't submit a review without at least giving 1
