With the exception of the remote, which paired quickly and took photos just fine, the ACTUAL tripod/stick/phone holder is extremely lightweight junk. My PHONE weighs more than this. In fact, if you attach your phone, and turn it to the side, it will tip over. I accidentally lightly tapped it with my foot and it almost toppled over. I had to catch it quickly because my phone was attached. Also, it has two places to screw your phone in, but you can only use ONE of them because the base underneath it sticks out too far to move your phone into the slot. Iâ€™m definitely going to get a model with a ball bearing to move the phone holder around. Having to screw and unscrew constantly whenever you want to adjust the angle a tiny bit is just TOO tedious and ridiculous. If you can, spend a little extra and get something better. This one is just plain annoying, cheaply made, and not thought out AT ALL.
