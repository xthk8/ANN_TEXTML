I have been in Cyber for a while and made this purchase recently. I am foolish for not having read the reviews prior. Upon arrival, I immediately noticed it was a sketchy product and tested it on my standalone system (unnetworked). It has all the red flags:1. Prompts users to disable antivirus prior to installing driver2. Made in unscrupulous China3. Upon software initiated restart, the CPU initiated a drive cleanse and was extremely sluggish.4. In order to remove the software, I had to deep dive into the registry editor.5. All signs lead to Chinese malware; spend the extra money elsewhere and avoid this product!6. This garbage went right into the garbage and I am spending triple the money on a US product. Advise the same.
