Notwithstanding the compatibility as advertised these cartridges do NOT work for the Brother MFC-J497DW. I've missed the Amazon return window (which is 100% on me), but very disappointed in this product. Don't be lured by potential cost savings, this product ended up being worthless to me. I'll stick with authentic Brother cartridges and (regretfully) bypass Amazon altogether in future purchases of my printer cartridges.
