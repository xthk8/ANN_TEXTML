I got this to film my YouTube videos and after reading all the great reviews, I expected this to be great. And I was disappointed. It sounds muffled and far away when I use it. The sound quality of my $20 lapel clip-on mic is much better than this. I wish I could like it, but when audio is so important to a great quality video, this mic just doesn't cut it.
