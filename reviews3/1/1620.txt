These were really disappointing ear buds. The biggest issue is that they simply won't stay in my ear, no matter which rubber adapter I use. If I'm listening to music and staying very still, they are fine, but if I'm using them for a phone call, the simple act of my speaking makes them fall out of my ear. Worse, every time I touch them to try to push them back in my ear, they interpret it as a "tap" and either the sound quality changes radically -- I start hearing myself in the earbuds while I'm speaking -- or the call gets disconnected.Thanks so much, Samsung, for replacing a $10 jacked-in earbud that worked perfectly well with an $100 bluetooth earbud that wont stay in my ear. I hated my last Samsung phone, I hate these Samsung earbuds, I hate my Samsung refrigerator and I REALLY hate my Samsung dishwasher. Time to stop buying Samsung products.Update: Earbuds returned
