I have about 6 of the old version of this extension cord/surge protector.The old version had several unbeatable features:--swivel head so you could have the cord angled in the right direction--flat head so you could put furniture against the outlet--long cord so you could use it behind a sofa and still have enough cord to plug things in.The new version is more than twice the width. It's absolutely huge. Not really flat at all.The new version has NO swivel head. It's locked in the down position. :(The new version is so thick at the head that's it awkward to plug in and almost impossible to plug in without touching the prongs as you push it into the socket which is incredibly dangerous.I thought perhaps I ordered the wrong brand but my old ones all have GE stamped on them, so they just made significant changes to make the product inferior. :(
