No matter how good a deal you think these are do not buy them. I am a teacher and I laminate all the time. These were a good deal and you get what you pay for I guess. They did not keep my sheets in place everything shifted as I was putting them in the laminator. The sides of the sheets curled up while being laminated and these had all kinds of bubbles in the finished product. Good thing I was only laminating things from the target dollar spot otherwise I would be pissed that it ruined my activities I spent good money on. I'm sad I am past the return window because I would definitely return if possible!
