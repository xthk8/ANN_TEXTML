The left earbud has gone out on three seperate pairs of these garbage headphones. The noise canceling speaker is wired poorly and comes loose and starts to make horrible noises, over your music or calls, popping and occasionally a very high pitched and loud tone. The solution provided by Sony is to turn off the noise canceling, which I'll give it to them, stops the noise... but then these are no different than my $15 dollar wireless headphones, and they honestly don't sound much better. I bought them for the noise canceling as I have a loud job. Don't waste your time or your money, get something else.
