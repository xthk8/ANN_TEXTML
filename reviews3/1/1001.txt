These ink Cartridges work as they should because HP make sure they're the only brand of ink that will work in an HP printer it's specified for. These printer companies are crooks IMO. These ink cartridges are way overpriced, runs out of ink too quickly, and they dry out too fast. And on top of that if you don't use HP branded paper many times the pages you try to print won't print.
