I purchased mine a little more than 6 months ago, back in May 2021. I tested it indoors for some minutes and it worked just as expected. I stored it (turned off) on my camera bag until recently, when I wanted to take some Christmas videos. It didn't turn on, so I connected it to a charger. Charging light remained green and it never held a charge. Tried with many different cables and chargers at no avail. It worked well with an external battery or charger but not with it's own battery.Since warranty is probably over, I opened it and found that the battery was swollen, has a crack and has corrosive leaks. Some corrosion is present on the main board but didn't affect it.I just ordered a 1800mAh battery, very similar to the original 2000mAh. It has not arrived yet but in theory it will do the job.Note: From my mini analysis of the circuit, charging light remains green if there is no current charging the battery. This happens normally when it has reached its nominal voltage. Also can happen when the battery is damaged and is not allowing any current in, as in this case.
