Â These lamination sheets are not good quality at all!! Really, I should of gave this product 0 STARS but there was no way I could do this considering you had to mark a star!! The first copy I had to stop release and pull sheet out, the sheet would not come through, reentered the sheet again and actually did get it to go through!! I actually did get all the crinkles out but the second sheet was NOT fixable!! I am not trying the third sheet!! Three strikes your OUT!! DO NOT GET THESE LAMINATOR SHEETS!! ESPECIALLY FOR YOUR PICTURES!! Not GOOD value for you money when you have to continue to pull out and get wrinkles all through the sheet!! My time is valuable and I canâ€™t have wasted time messing with laminator sheets that is NO GOOD and I have wasted time with a lot to do!! Planning with nothing getting done this weekend and kiddos that needs these sheets for IDI!! ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
