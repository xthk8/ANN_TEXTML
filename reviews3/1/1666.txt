Family member purchased in April 2022 for sleeping. The right speaker on the unit failed within 3 months or so. I purchased it a second time for use by the same person.in July 2022. Again, the right speaker failed after about 4.5 months. and cannot return product(s). Also, if the user has a rather large hat size, the speakers within the headband will not stay in place as the stretched material retracts a little if overstretched. If I could give zero stars I would. If you want to burn $20 try a match instead of this Musicozy; your disappointment and frustration will be gone a lot quicker.
