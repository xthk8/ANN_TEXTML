When I replaced my old cartridge with the "new:," genuine ink cartridge from the HP Store, my printer gave me the message that it was a Previously Used cartridge. It then gave me a message that the cartridge was low on ink. The item came in an original box that had been sealed with a piece of white paper tape. The Cartridge inside was not in a sealed plastic bag, and it did not have a piece of tape over the metal piece as they all do. I purchased this specific item from this site because I thought it was a legitimate site. The reviews were good. I am not happy. It took a long time to get this cartridge to begin with... When I went to Customer Support I found that this was HP-India, not HP US. This was not indicated on the HP Store site accessed from Amazon when I purchased the cartridge.
