I had this popsocket for 3 days. It fell off my phone every time I tried to use it. I could literally feel it sliding down my case when I was holding my phone. The adhesive is garbage. Like other reviewers, there was a piece that broke off inside the pop socket that made it so I couldn't close the dumb thing all the way. What a waste of $10
