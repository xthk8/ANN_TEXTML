I bought this product because I needed a card to record events captured on my dashcam. It worked great for the first couple of months but suddenly stopped recording at full capacity. It seemed to me there was a bad segment. It allowed me to format and it would record again once I formatted the card, but it’ll get stuck again at roughly the same area (in terms of capacity). It recorded at full capacity only twice before it started acting up.I bought a Sandisk card for similar purpose in (dashcam on my other car). The Sandisk card wasn’t even advertised for its endurance and it certainly was exposed to more extreme temperatures than the Samsung card (longer commutes, generally hotter temperature) but it performed better and hasn’t had corruption issue to date. Both cards were bought within days of each other (Sandisk card bought days before Samsung card). Sure the Samsung card is cheaper but is it worth the agony over not knowing whether an important event will get recorded? Hardly.
