Opened box to find the sony box to look like it had been opened, not sealed. Opened up that box to find nothing sealed, including the camera screen, no battery in box, unless it was already in camera. There were no tabs to pull to enable battery. Fingerprints were all over camera screen, and the camera was very dirty. cords were not tied up, microphone cover was dirty, and messy. I did not even try to power it on, just initiated a return.
