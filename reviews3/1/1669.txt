I wanted to like this, but I got it and followed all the directions, but it wouldn’t turn on. I figured it just needed to be charged. Nope. It showed a blue light when it was charged, but no matter how many times or how long I pushed the button, it wouldn’t turn on. I even checked my blue tooth to see if it actually was on, but it wasn’t. Sadly, I’ll be returning them. Oh, and the fabric is pretty thin and lets in quite a bit of light, so if you were hoping for a mask it wouldn’t work.
