Others have pointed out issues with the arm itself breaking, from flexing it into different positions over and over, which is a poor enough design already, but what if you don't move the arm after you set it up, like I did?It still breaks.Simply using the clamp that holds your phone in place, maybe a couple times a day, the plastic 'jaws' broke - if you look at the pictures (more carefully than I did) you'll see its just these tiny pieces of plastic where it's hinged, and it will break.Do not buy unless you want to throw money away.
