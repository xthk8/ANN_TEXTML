I wanted a pair of Apple wired headphones to replace my AirPods so I could reduce my EMF exposure, and when I got these, I realized quickly they are NOT Apple headphones, and they are BLUETOOTH even though they are wired. When I plugged them in, a Bluetooth pairing pop up came up for “beats” (see photo) and showed some other headphones in the picture. I connected them and went into my Bluetooth settings and sure enough, there they were (see photo). Now things got really weird when my daughter plugged them into HER phone and they were still playing the music on MY PHONE! These are some weird garbage and still expose your brain to Bluetooth signals. Do not buy.
