Bought this earlier this year anticipating that I would need it. Installed it, used it a few times, but then when I needed to print anything with yellow, it wont work. EVERYTHING comes out purple. It registers full, but clearly its defective. I am past the return date. Take this as a warning, install it upon getting it. I am passed the return window. Going to the physical store to pay more, but at least if I install and it is defective I can return same day. This is not the first time I have paid for "genuine" HP ink and it was faulty.
