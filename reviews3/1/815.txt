So I bought these about 4 months or so ago. The first one pair one of the charging pins was broken out of the box. Hey, it happens. I get the replacement and just dismissed the poor range and battery life. I figured I was just getting interference from the equipment I work around. And the battery was getting depleted faster being at max volume. Then i borrowed my wifes rose gold ones. I can listen to hers for 6 to 8 hours before they start to die. Mine die in about 3 or 4 hours of I'm lucky. But its the range that has me angry. Mine, I get more than 5 to 10 feet away I start loosing signal. Sometimes I loose it while its in my pocket but i dismissed it as interference from the amount of metal around me. With hers I can be 30 or 40 feet away and don't loose signal until I have a block wall or two between me and my phone. I wish I had noticed the discrepancy sooner when it was still in the 90 days. Did I just happen to get 2 rejects or is this the quality of the black ones? I only got them on may 10th or so. They should not be this bad this fast. I dont even know if they were this bad when I got them and just never noticed the discrepancy. Or I didn't use the other pair enough to make the connection that somwthing wasn't right.
