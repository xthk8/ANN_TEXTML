It’s a great thing they give you 3 chargers because you get about 3 days use out of them before they give out on you. Stashed them since Christmas and barely started using them last week and already gone through 2 out of the 3 cords. I’m betting the last one works for similar amount of time.… Only giving one star because it at least works… for a few days.
