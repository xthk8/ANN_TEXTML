I purchased 3 ink cartridges in June. Ran out of ink just last week. But nowhere does it say this cartridge will not work for a printer in the Caribbean. Un-flipping believable. I never heard of such a thing. Now I have one cartridge that I opened and really...I will have to toss it. But two more...one black and the other tri-color that I cannot use. I sent these to my husband while he was visiting family in New York. The shipping was no problem and very timely. We are allowed to bring in without duty payment some USD$400 worth of goods on our person per year. By shipping it to him while he was in the states, this ink became part of his allowance. Now I either pay upwards of 3 times the purchase price (shipping, duty and profit from the store of purchase) or wait until one of us again goes abroad. We now know which one to get...but Amazon says nothing about the fact that ink cartridges are specific to the country you purchase your printer in!! I bet you there are lots of people who do not realize that these ink cartridges are not universal in terms of location. Amazon...you are dropping the ball and I am out the price of three ink cartridges. Not a happy camper.
