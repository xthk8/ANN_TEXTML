The first thing I noticed right out of the box, I could not plug in to one of the USB ports.Looking at the close-up photo, it is clear that the top USB port is not aligned with the hole.No wonder I couldn't plug in my USB cable into it.I happened to have with me two Addtam power strips that are similar to OneBeat.Both Addtam power strips have outlets on three sides which make them very useful.Too bad, OneBeat power strip only has outlets on two sides.I think that is a clear disadvantage against the competitor.Other than that, they share many similar design elements, that I suspect both brands come from the same manufacturer or use the same third-party original design.Despite the clear disadvantage, I bought the OneBeat anyway because I was wondering if the wider spacing between outlets is enough for my need.I have several plugs (power adapters, dimmer switches etc) that are wide.I measured with a digital caliper that OneBeat power strip has 1.85in spacing between outlets.While this is wider than Addtam's 1.5in spacing, it is still not wide enough to allow my large plugs to sit next to each other.There are two-row power strips from OneBeat, Halycony and Addtam brands that have 2.2in between outlets. Why not make the spacing the same with the single-row power strip?As seen in photo, that power strip can have 3 of my wide plugs side by side.For product improvement, I hope both OneBeat and Addtam will produce a single row power strip which has 2.2in between outlets.I also hope that the next version of this OneBeat product will have outlets all on 3 sides, not just two sides. It makes it more versatile.I still have to give 1 star rating because one of the USB ports is defective and I have to waste my time returning the product to Amazon.
