Started Reddit reading on these ear buds before you buy them. I have red nothing but bad from several Reddit users and online users about a humming noise that I didn’t see in reviews on Amazon. It’s apparently in specific batches, and really bad with refurbished pairs. Several people have tried returning their head phones, with new pairs that make the same sound.It’s relatively loud, and only happens with transparency or noice canceling turned on. If you don’t care about those modes, they work fine. But will not be able to hair anything except a loud buzzing in noise canceling and transparency mode. I have tried to use multiple phone, iPhone, android, and google. I’ve even tried my laptop. Will not stop unless I turn off those modes. Regardless if anything is playing, or not playing.
