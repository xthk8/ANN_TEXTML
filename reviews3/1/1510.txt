dont waste your time and/or money on this piece of junk. i bought this to connect my canon R10 to my ipad through the camera connect and control app.... when i plugged everything in, nothing happened at all. the app wasnt registering that it was plugged into the camera. i made sure my USB access was enabled, turned on and off, tried again a few times and it still wouldnt work. came to the item page to see what the reviews said about this issue and realized i need to download a different app?? not at ALL why i purchased this. i dont need an app for a simple piece of hardware. this app does not in anyway seem secure either.note about the app:-it is BARELY functional. very slow. takes tapping a menu item several times for it to register.-you cannot update the firware if anything is plugged into it at all. (power source or hdmi)-even if you can update it, the app still wont work.-just put it back in the bag, delete the app, and return it.
