Our chargers are always disappearing in our house. And I was tired of hearing/saying where's a charger! After I first purchased these then I bought 4 more, then another 4 more 2 weeks later, so we had a total of 12 in all our outlets. They were so cheap, why not? One by one, they stopped working. (The cords were good. I checked those through the computers.) It was the chargers itself. I thought maybe the kids were being too rough with them, so I left 2 in my computer's power strip. No one in the house uses the strip except me, and I never touch it. I took 1 from each purchasing set, from 2nd &3rd batches. Sure enough, both stopped working after 3 weeks, respectively. Chargers also got super hot. When I mean stopped woring, my phone/tablet had that awful message, check your charger. Charging took 8 hrs versus 1hr. Then, it started to pull power from my devices. Where I was at 20% power, it dropped quickly 19, 18% very quickly, moreso than if it wasn't connected to the charger. I came here to reach out to Supplier and saw more of these reviews. The good reviews are either paid, work for supplier, or didn't wait long enough to write an accurate review. I'm not surprised if you keep looking at more reviews, you'll see a lot of "stopped working" reviews. Yeah. Why is that? My several years old chargers issued from Samsung directly are still working same as when I first purchased the device. Save yourself aggravation. If you want consistency and reliability, look elsewhere.
