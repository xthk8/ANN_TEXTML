What is absolutely hysterical about this product is it's practically impossible to find online unless it's sold third party. Try it - Amazon, Target, WalMart, whatever. And to even further the irony, I chose to avoid the Best Buy one because it's got Alexa crap on it and I refuse to have any association whatsoever with that software. So, knowing the odds were completely against me, I rolled the dice here and lost.If you are anything like me, you're trying to distance yourself from using Amazon yet you still use it here and there because the returns are easy. Take a look at the box this arrived in. I was even silly enough to roll the dice again - charge it, flash it, and test it. Outbound quality was good, but inbound sucked and it failed in the middle of a call at 53 minutes.If you're anything like me you've learned that even when an item on Amazon is "sold by" the manufacturer's storefront (which this was not), you're taking a chance at receiving B stock product. I am so utterly finished with Amazon for allowing crap like this to happen.
