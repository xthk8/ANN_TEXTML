Everything thing works well but the knob and screw that hold the camera upright on the frame. No matter how hard I tighten the screw, the weight of the IPhone pulls the camera down. It just flips on the end of the swivel. I think it is tight but pick it up…flop! If the camera won’t hold on the swivel, nothing else matters. Not worth any cost. Returning for a refund
