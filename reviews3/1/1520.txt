Very cheaply made. It is not completely black as pictured; it has this cheap white ring as if the black was spray-painted onto a white circle. I purchased a pop socket a few years ago in-store so I know what the quality level should be. The old one finally gave out so I ordered this online. Just head over to your local tech store because this was a rip-off.
