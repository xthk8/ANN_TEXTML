The headphones default to 100% volume, FYI. I even made sure to set them to 15% my first listen, but when I charged them and put them back in my ears they annihilated me by blasting at full volume directly into my brain, which is a very good product design and definitely what I wanted (it isn't). Also if you gently tap on the left earbud, it will Skyrocket the volume to 100%, which is absolutely TERRIBLE. So if you remove the earbud and put it back in your ear, you will meet your untimely eardrum demise. Simply adjusting the pod should not reset the volume to MAX.Sound quality is fine for music, but on discord or if you are using the microphone, it's garbled and full of static, like it's fighting a radio station (so the call function is also garbage).Noise cancelation is as much as earbuds in your ears can do, because you're all plugged up, but there isn't anything special going on compared to my over-the-ear noise cancellation headphones. The most noise cancellation is from my eardrums ringing from the volume jumping to 100% randomly multiple times :) my ears hurt as I write this review, which I rushed to do before even beginning my return process.
