I typically order one cartridge ahead of what I need and ordered this in April and its return date finished on May 20. When I put the cartridge in around May 8, it worked fine. Then on June 16 my printer started having issues and it constantly said that the ink cartridge was incompatible. I finally took it out and replaced it with another color cartridge that I had waiting and everything works fine. I went to look into returning this faulty cartridge and my window for returns was up on May 20. It’s an XL and I paid a lot of money for it so I’m pretty discouraged but I have no recourse. I feel the cartridge was defective and I’m really disappointed.
