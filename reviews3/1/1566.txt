I literally just got this in the mail 20 mins ago. Followed the step by step directions. Used all the right tools and screws. Everything seemed great! Was watching a movie and all of a sudden there was a loud glass breaking sound and I jumped up to grab the TV before it fell over!! The tempered glass shattered right before my eyes! I did research to make sure this would support my 65 in(I bout the 700 dollar tv just 2 days before I bought this stand thank God the TV didn't receive any damage) i want my money back now!!!
