When I received the ink cartridges they were sealed in their plastic wrap. They did feel somewhat light when I took them from the plastic wrap. Everything installed just fine. The cartridges showed full. When I printed the page came out missing many words with very faint printing. I cleaned the cartridges and it seemed to get better. I ran through the cleaning process again and it got a little better. Then all of a sudden the machine beeped and said to replace the cartridges. It showed the ink at the bottom of the indicator with red X's. I took the cartridges out and they were completely empty. Two cleaning will not empty a cartridge. I noticed quite a few people saying the same thing. I guess it is hit and miss with this company because there are a lot of people giving 5 stars. Possible they did that before they ran into a problem running out of ink early. In fact one of the 5 star people I saw did but she still gave them 5 stars. Strange why they would do that. If you buy from this seller it believe you will be gambling. If you flip and coin and get heads you will or tails you lose. BTW I have only given probably 3 negative reports since buying on line since 1999. I think this seller needs to dbl check his source for ink cartridges. They are not giving them what they are paying for or this seller is knowingly selling defective product.
