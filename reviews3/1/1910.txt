My use for this cable was to just get video between my laptop and my 40" TV. I use it for Telework (Telecommuting). I always use Blue Jeans Cable and had an 8 foot Series-FE HDMI cable from BJC that served this purpose exceptionally well. I don't do gaming and I have to have this working all the time, without fail.This KabelDirekt 15 foot HDMI cable fell flat on it's face. I am no novice when it comes to computers. I thought with all those 5 stars, I'll spend $12 instead of $43.75 to get a new 15 foot HDMI cable. This KabelDirekt purchase was a complete waste.It would not sync up to the television. I decided to reboot the laptop since this was the cable's first hookup (Note: I NEVER have to reboot my laptop when I use BJC HDMI Cable. If we didn't rearrange the room such that I now needed a 15ft cable, I would have never tried to buy a cable that was not from BJC. It just pained me that I obsoleted my 8 foot BJC Series-FE HDMI cable only because we rearranged the room I use it in).I did everything I could to make the synchronization stable. EVERYTHING. If the computer slept, I lost synchronization. If the screen saver came on, I lost synchronization. I wasted time and money on this.Just to double check I wasn't insane, I temporarily moved my laptop closer to the TV so that the BJC 8 foot Series-FE HDMI cable could reach the TV. The KabelDirekt 15 foot HDMI cable was currently plugged in with the TV not able to synchronize with the laptop. I swapped out the 15 foot KabelDirekt cable with the 8 FOOT BJC cable and within the blink of an eye, the laptop was synchronized with the TV. No reboots, no configuration changes. Merely a swap out of HDMI cables.This KabelDirekt 15 foot cable is on its way to the electric recycling program. I have ordered my BJC 15 Foot Series FE HDMI cable which is now on Amazon and like all the other cables I order from BJC, I know I made the right decision.... I will NEVER stray from BJC again.
