Under pressed is an understatement!! The ring light DID NOT ATTACH to the base from the time I got it out of the box!!! I tried to work with it for several days with no avail!!! How do you make a ring light in the ring does not clip on? So sad my child threw the box away before I could return it.Omg!üò±üò± Then, after reading my, ANONYMOUS‚Äù post of the product, the company contacted me via email, offering to compensate me for the deleting or editing MY NEGATIVE review!!! This is unreal!! This review was posted ANONYMOUSLY for this VERY REASON!!! How did they even find out who I am???? Disgusted with Amazon to!!! DO NOT THINK YOUR POSTS ARE ACTUALLY ANONYMOUS!!
