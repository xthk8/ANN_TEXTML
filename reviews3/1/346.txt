The past 5 years, I'd used a 2015 Jabra USB headset, for which this is a replacement. That was so durably made, it traveled a few dozen trips in my bag, many places around the world.In this new model, the addition of USB is great. I also like that it can be set to pair simultaneously with two or more devices, which can preempt a desktop connection, by an incoming mobile call, etc.But the sound quality is literally the worst I have ever experienced with my MacBook Pros. This is true both wired and wireless. Music sounds like you are tuned between AM stations! This deteriorates if you adjust playback mid-stream.Voice quality is generally good, but the whole unit is subject to unexpected shutoff, which requires a wireless power-cycling, or unplugging the USB and re-inserting it. This can drop calls with some client software.It will also occasionally inject streams of beeps and squeals into Zoom or MS Teams calls - which are only audible to the OTHER participants, who must mute you to continue, until you unplug the Jabra and reconnect, etc.Last of all, I appreciate the rejection of background noise when speaking. Sadly, this comes at the price of being VERY particular about placement of the microphone element, which must be in such proximity to your mouth, that it sits like a black bar in front of your face in video calls.As much as I loved my previous unit, I TRULY HATE this Jabra device, and urge you to spend HALF as much on a no-name competitor, than suffer the same weeks I did, hoping to justify the purchase.Never again, Jabra.
