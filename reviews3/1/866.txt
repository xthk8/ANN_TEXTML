I had high hopes for this earphones since it has nothing but good reviews but I am disappointed, it did not charge and when I thought it did wouldn't connect to the phone, I must say I tried everything I looked up to videos on Youtube and everything but it was of no success, the worst part of all of it that it was a gift for my aunt who lives in another country, I left it with my cousin to see if the case discharges the battery with time and give it another go.
