I was so excited to put my photos in here for sage keeping. It’s completely broken on one end and all my pictures fell out. It’s only been in a storage closet neatly stocked on a shelf. I went to grab it and one side was falling apart. It’s been in touched since I put the photos in and put it away. I’m disappointed.
