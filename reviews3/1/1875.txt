I recently lost one of my earpieces for LinkBuds S. So far they have been my favorite headphones and I now feel the lack of them extremely. I thought that replacing a piece would be easy enough and to my surprise found out that Sony doesn't offer their customers an option to replace one of the ear pieces like Apple does. Even more, turns out that even if you find a replacement piece on the market (on Ebay e.g.) you will not be able to use it with your original unit - as they will not synchronize or work together even if you reset them in the same case to their factory settings. It's actually in the unit's mechanics to only be able to work with its original set. On their official website Sony refer to United Radio as the only service center that can help to deal with such problem and pair the new pair. Unfortunately, they don't work with LinkBuds S entirely, as their representatives say.Hereby, my question:Is sony making me buy an entirely new pair of headphones? Or will there ever be solution to something so easy to solve?
