These microphones are cheaply made, and you can tell one of the mic was blown out when I first tried itOnly one of them sounds pretty decent these microphones are not good for medium to loud sounds they cut out if you are talking too loud or if a dog barks that is around I do not recommend this just save your money and buy better quality one good thing is that they are plug and play did not have any troubles
