I took this out of the box maybe an hour or so ago. Plugged in 6 items and it worked great for about 20 minutes then randomly shut off and won’t turn back on. Have tried different outlets, unplugging cords, etc. It’s basically just dead. Very disappointed. I bought it based on the good reviews so not sure if I got a bad unit or what but again, very disappointed.
