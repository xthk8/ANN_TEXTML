I could be learning or doing something more productive but I'll waste sometime & write a review today.So I bought multiple headphones & not to experiment. I just want something that works good,so here Is what I've tried:They all sounded like trash but here's the list:1. HROEENOI JZ022. Silensys E73. MOVSSOU E74. Srhythm Renewed NC355. Srhythm Renewed NC256. Soundcore by Anker Space Q457. Soundcore Anker Life Q20Ok who is rating this trash? 7,160 Reviews? Really?When I activate "Active Noise canceling" (ANC" Is weird that I can hear my own heart beat & when I walk I can hear my steps like bass on this cheap headphones.If you can't afford the good headphones Just get something for $20 to get the job done.& that lady in the background that says: BlueTooth connected or Power OFF or Power ON, is the same female on all 7 headPhones. LoL (^_^)
