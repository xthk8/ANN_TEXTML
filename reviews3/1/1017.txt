I always order my cartridges ahead, so I have them on hand when needed. They have always worked before. I always us HP original cartridges which are very expensive. However, this cartridge will not work. Printer says it is damaged. Have tried the customer service chat line but it just doesn't work. It says cartridge can be replaced but when I try to get the return label it will not let me. I have all of the info but to no avail.
