I was convinced after my first two weeks of owning these that I would love them. A month in, and I'm livid. They now crackle if more than one sound is played at a time. Mid range is fine, but treble and bass cracks, sounds muffled, and fades in and out. Took a chance on this company and now I regret it. Pay a little more for something better.
