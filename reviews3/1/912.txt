Bought the high endurance card after a failure of our last one resulted in the loss of critical footage; we didn't realize the camera had not been recording until after we tried checking the video (which means it was too late).Bought this one based off online recommendations, and it seemed to work great. We checked it periodically to make sure it was working, and it seemed OK. However, this review today comes after an incident on the road where we needed to recover the footage, and the card simply stopped functioning while it was being accessed on my computer. One minute I was looking over video, the next minute the card was inaccessible. Tried different card readers and ports, all without luck. It's suddenly dead, and I don't have the video I was looking for.This was purchased in early June 2020, and the car was not used as often due to the pandemic and associated travel restrictions, so I definitely didn't put it through its claimed paces. Disappointing!
