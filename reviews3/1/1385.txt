I received my order today 01/18/2023, it was quite easy to install. Tried to print some documents, it came out totally blurry, I felt maybe cos I didn't shake it or my printer ink settings needed a self clean up or settings needed adjustment. I did all that, it still printed some blurry papers when the setting finally got cleaned, next thing I know my printer tells me I've run out of ink .....like how??? I'm so upset cos I still have more documents to print but now I'm out of ink and just wasted money and time! I totally regret this purchase!!
