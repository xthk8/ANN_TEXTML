I bought these to have a few extra when we go on trips or people are over and need to charge. Well one of the charges is defective upon opening the package. The one one tells us we are using a slow charging charger. I would not recommend this crap to anyone. One top of that in order to get it returned I have to drive over an hr to ups or pay a huge fee to have ups come back and get this crap.
