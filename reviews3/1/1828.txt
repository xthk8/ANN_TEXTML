Why BROTHER would you make an ink LC203 and LC20E that are identical in size and shape. I have ordered this over dozen times and have used this printer for over five years. I ordered it as I normally do (I make it a habit to order new ink as soon as I replace it in the printer...so I don’t run out).Then, I spent over two hours trying everything I could think of to get it to work, including resetting my printer. I wasted precious time trying to figure out why this would not work and kept telling me it couldn’t detect the ink and to reinstall.I almost started shopping for a new printer. Then I looked very closely and it was off by one letter/number and cartridges were exactly the same size and shape. I’m just so frustrated about this. If you choose to make them that close you had better send the right cartridges. I wasted money because I double checked what I ordered and I did order the right ink!!
