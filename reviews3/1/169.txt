The manufacturer divided the bracket into multiple pieces, perhaps to allow it to be in a smaller box. Due to the way the pieces fit together, the bracket may not fit your TV, it would not fit mine. Also, the hex bolts are badly machined. Some did not even have a hex head, just a faint imprint of one, and the threads on some of the bolts was bad.I wish I had caught this before the return window closed. Now I just have metal for the recycling bin.
