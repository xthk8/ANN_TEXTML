I love this product. The amount of customization that you can do to the earbuds is wonderful. Noise cancellation is great and it works. I am a student in mechanical technician that takes the city bus and you can't hear nothing however the downside is that you sacrifice the battery life for the active notice cancellation. If you aren't doing noice cancellation it can easily last you 3 days without having to charge the case. And if you are a active notice cancellation person it would last you 2 days without charging the case. I truly recommend this product to anyone that question if it is worth the money.Edit: The left earbud just went out and when an earbud goes out it just makes the whole thing not work so not worth the money.
