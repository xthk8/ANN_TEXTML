It would have a higher rating but their customer service doesn't exist. No one answers the customer service phone or emails.My unit lost one of it's felt grip feet (regular felt is to slippery and rubber doesn't give at all).I ask that they send me a replacement felt foot. Seems simple enough under their Lifetime Warranty Service: They are on West coast. One first class stamp and it's all done. Nope. Not Lamicall... NO ONE HOME...!!"【What You Get】: One Lamicall S stand, as well as our Lifetime Warranty Service. Offering you a full refund or a brand new replacement if you are not satisfied with it. Table stand please search a.co/bZMwoPO "I like the product. I would be better with a full felt back and landing area... even or especially around the edge.It's handy letting me charge it standing up right (HTC One M8 and even a 7-inch tablet and 10-inch tablet horizontally. I use wireless BlueTooth keyboard/mouse when I need an app that only runs on Android.But, the issue with the missing feet is annoying as much as the company's lack of integrity and support. Going to file a complaint with Amazon against the company for false advertisement of their products. There is no warranty or customer service.
