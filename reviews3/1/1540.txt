This extension cord floor cover does not lie flat. It came coiled in a box and I let it lie flat on the kitchen counter for a week. Both ends still would not lie flat, but I only need a 12" length. So I cut it with tin snips out of the middle section which was lying flat. As soon as it is cut, it starts curling. I tried a second time using a utility knife. I got the same result. It will not lie flat on hardwood. I hate to use two sided tape because this will be on the hardwoods a long time and I am worried about the tape leaving a permanent residue. If the manufacturer could send me a 12" piece that lies perfectly flat on a hard surface, I would love to receive it.
