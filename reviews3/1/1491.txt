This unit worked fine for the first month and then started having crackling noise in the middle of a call. It happens from time to time throughout a call but can't tell exactly when it would happen. It is frustrating to pay good amount of $ for a product that doesn't work well. When this happens on the call, I cannot hear the person on the other side and have to ask them to repeat. It is quite frustrating. I can't return the product because it is past the return period. I had the prior version for many years and it worked very well. I hope the seller will replace the product.
