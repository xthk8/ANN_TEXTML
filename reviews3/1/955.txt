Update: The replacement mic didn’t work AT ALL. Tried it on multiple phones and laptops but it didn’t work at all. You would think they would make sure to send me one that works when they sent a replacement for the one with a lose connection but nope. I won’t buy anything from this brand ever again.Update: the customer service was very responsive and is sending me a replacement. Looks like it might just be defective. I’ll update once I have the replacement to see if that corrects the issue.I’ve been trying to find a good mic for YouTube videos that I record using my iPhone 11 Pro Max. I had a lot of hope for this mic but the first time I used it, the volume is super low and it was popping and clicking constantly throughout the video. When I loaded into iMovie to do some editing, the visual of the audio wasn’t right. It would show audio peaking when there was no sound. I couldn’t locate where my sentences started or ended. It was a mess which sucks because I was filming harvesting vegetables from my garden so I can’t redo the video. Disappointing. I’m requesting a replacement with hopes it’s just a faulty item and not a bad product
