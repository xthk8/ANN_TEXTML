I am livid that this device doesn't work. I plugged it in to my computer and attached the HDMI cord to it and nothing. I checked to make sure the HDMI cable foe my monitor worked when plugged directly into my laptop and that worked fine. It is the adapter, this product, that doesn't work. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. I'm furious!!!
