I've lived in Plantronics headsets for 15 years that had great sound, were comfortable all day long, and could be tossed down on a desk with little consequence when a call was over. Their newer line is a disaster on all these fronts. They used to have a nice microphone that sat on the outside of the ear with a cloth cover, but this highly functional and comfortable variant has been discontinued, as verified by direct contact with the manufacturer. On the new model, the earpiece options are a cumbersome over the head clip that could be from the 60's, or an intrusive and uncomfortable ear gel that sticks down into the ear, gets tiring during even a short call, and worst of all, delivers wretched and muffled sound. The button on the back is very sensitive and the ear gel makes the set tip easily, so if you want to set it down anywhere but it's cradle, you have to carefully balance it on the gel or it flips over, presses its own button, and picks up the phone. I'm sure somebody out there likes this model for some reason because they built it, but it's incomprehensible to me that they discontinued far more functional versions for the rest of us. Utterly incompetent project design.
