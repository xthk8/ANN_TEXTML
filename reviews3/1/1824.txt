I always order my ink and toner from Amazon, but may start paying more to buy in store. This is the second order for OEM ink cartridges that appear to be full (by the window on the cartridge) but are not putting out ink. Presuming clogged nozzles due to age/storage. The first order eventually worked after about 3 rounds of "cleaning" by the printer maintenance function. This order is putting out NO INK after 4 rounds of cleaning so far. Very disappointing.
