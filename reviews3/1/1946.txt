I bought a GE power strip rather than a no-name power strip specifically because I don't want to take risks where electricity is concerned. This power strip arrived today, I plugged it in, and I plugged a few devices into it, including a halogen lamp. The lamp had been working perfectly for years, but within minutes of my plugging it into this GE power strip, I started smelling something burning. To my surprise, smoke was rising from the halogen lamp. Unplugged everything, am throwing away the GE power strip and ordering Belkin, which has always been reliable for me.
