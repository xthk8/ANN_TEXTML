My biggest problem is the issues connecting, the sound is fine, the battery is fine, petty much all the other features are fine. However, more than half the time they won't connect to my phone, laptop, etc. I'm not sure if it's the bluetooth or if the case/earbuds aren't disconnecting from each other or what, but it's annoying. For the $13 I spent I wasn't expecting much, but I basically can't use them at all...
