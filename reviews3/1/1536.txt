I’ve had bad luck with generic phone grips, but Popsocket brand has always lasted a long time…until now. The packaging looks legit, but when I reached out to Popsocket about my Amazon order, they told me that “Amazon.com Services LLC is not an authorized seller”. Amazon did refund my money, but I’m still frustrated that the grip broke off from the base in a way that couldn’t be fixed ONLY 5 HOURS AFTER PROPERLY ATTACHING TO MY PHONE CASE. That’s just ridiculous. The base is adhered on very tightly, so I have to figure out how to get it off to put a new one on. Fair warning… it could be a random situation, but to be cautious of this when selecting this grip for your phone. It’s so cute, so I’m really bummed about this.
