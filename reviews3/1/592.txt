I used this about five times in total and the first couple times it worked well, but I noticed occasionally it would be spotty with working and the calibration is off. I tried to use it during lecture and it literally stopped working and I had to hold it a certain way just to erase. its very frustrating when I can't write during lecture. returning ASAP.
