* I have purchased this item 21 times and have had to return it for a replacement or a refund at least 5 of those times. You would think for the price you pay for this stuff it wouldn't leak but boy does it leak!This is the 2nd time I have got a leaking toner. For the price you would expect a way better quality & no leaking. We are now on return #3 of leaking toner. I would expect this from cheap knock off toner not from expensive OEM toner!Not returning this time because I have used a little over half of the toner but now it is leaking everywhere again. I don't understand why they charge so much for this stuff and it leaks. I expect better quality for the price paid.I have about 30% of my toner left and yet again it has leaked all over the place.and again at half of my toner left and it's leaked all inside my printer.
