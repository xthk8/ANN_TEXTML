Prior to travel, purchased color and black cartridges, which arrived overnight. Ink cartridges arrived without stop (See Photo 1) and was not shrink wrapped, which was normal shipping over the year. Appear to be used cartridges which were not completely refilled. See photo #2. On 5 SEPT22, after two months in storage, replaced magenta, yellow and black cartridges. After printing approximately 30 sheets, cartridges are near empty (See photo #2). Lastly, black ink prints light, difficult to read. Never had this problem with previous orders. Unfortunately, missed return cutoff due to travel for work. Am forced to find new source of computer cartridges!! I do not set time & date.
