Replaced mine within 3 weeks. Fabric stretched and needed constant adjusting. The “knot” for adjusting was uncomfortable when resting on a desk while typing.An obvious thing I still want to mention is it’s fabric, so if you wear it in the shower it’s going to be wet for a while. Again I’m captain obvious here, but It became irritating when wearing dress shirts.Of the pack of 5, I wore one. I won’t be wearing the other and have since bought another silicone one.
