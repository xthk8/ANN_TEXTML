I got this for work, I'm on the phone a lot and the mute button does NOT work for MS Teams or other PC apps. This only works on mobile. It's a small thing, but I need to be able to mute on the headset if I walk away or something. This was advertised as for calls, and I'm a little peeved that I have to return this and find another.
