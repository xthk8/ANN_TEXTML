The cartridge must have been very very old or defective because the single page that printed resulted in the printer not working (this is an HP Envy 4500) and not registering the cartridge as valid for the printer. There was no workaround to getting the printer to only print black and white. Once I took out the faulty ink cartridge, I found that the ink was leaking out of the packaging and obscuring the sensors that read the product in the printer. We do not use our printer all that much, and we rarely, if ever print in color. We only have this color part because the printer requires it to print anything. I want a replacement for this, clearly, defective product -- but that is not possible because we are outside of the return window (it has been less than 120 days since purchase). For comparison, the last set of printer cartridges we purchased for the printer lasted us 2 years.
