The box had mixed sizes. The small ones in no way could fit on my first gen AirPods pro (apple product). The tubes that are inside that are meant to pop in the pro are way too small. I wish I had checked them out earlier so I could have gotten a refund. It was only about $12 to get the small one from the Apple store online for my first gen pro.
