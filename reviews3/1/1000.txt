I've been using HP printers for a long time as well as their ink cartridges - I've never had an issue with any of their products and have only replaced printers after years of constant use. I recently purchased a new printer and got the HP 61 Ink Cartridge Bundle from Amazon to keep as a back up a few months ago - printer ink always seems to run out when you're not expecting it to and need to print things out most. This was the first time that I purchased printer ink from Amazon (I usually go to Target or stores like Best Buy). I'm not sure what happened but the cartridges I got were defective. Upon replacing the cartridge, I noticed that the ink level was not full and almost at the empty point. After test printing a few things, it was determined that the printer worked fine but the text and images always came out faded with the cartridges.
