While this is a great tip for the pencil and truly feel like writing on paper, it has scratched my ipad severely. I got a paper-like screen protector and it is almost completely now scratched. I am not sure why this is but absolutely do not use without a screen protector!! It didn't scratch when I first started using it but I think it started to wear down after about a week and is getting continually worse. I don't recommend.
