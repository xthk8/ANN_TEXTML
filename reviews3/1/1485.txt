I have Sandisk Extreme Pro V30 and bought this V90 to use for 4K videos. Tested both on my PC using CrystalDiskMark 8.0.4 and the V30 was faster in all categories. I was surprised!! So I tested the card with my Sony RX100 VII camera and did a 100-shot burst. The V30 finished the write buffer in 1 minute and 37 seconds, and the V90 finished in 2 minutes and 6 seconds!!! I really don't know what's going on with this card, but for sure I will return it!
