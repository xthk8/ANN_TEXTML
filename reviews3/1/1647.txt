Update, Feb 2022: Storied history with this: after having the trouble outlined in my first review (below) where the package was missing the USB cable (returned and bought again), now a year and a half later, the mic is dead. And of course it died while I was taping a podcast episode with a guest with 500k IG followers. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Need a new mic before Tuesday so I can finish this week‚Äôs episode. Not going for third time‚Äôs a charm.Original review, July 2020: Just opened this for use with my Mac and while it came with the XLR cable (no plans to use), it didn't come with the USB cable (the one I need). There is also no sign of the carrying pouch. The packaging was sealed and did not appear to be tampered with. UPDATE: Seller took it back, no problem, got the refund in a reasonable amount of time. Best that could have been expected.
