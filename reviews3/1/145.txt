what I ordered and what I got was totally not what I thought it was going to be in the descriptions in the picture standing in reality for $25. I got a plastic toy no thanks you know it’s bad when you don’t even wanna return it? You just want to leave it alone? Honestly, I don’t even know why am writing this review. Have a great day.
