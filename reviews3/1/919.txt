WARNING!BRITTLE FRAGILE cracked SAMSUNG PRO Endurance 32GB MicroSDXC, 2022.05 !!! riskymine was either damaged (cracked thoroughly) by shipping or by me somehow not being careful despite me using NO STRESS and strong utility knife far from chip on a well lit sturdy cutting benchI assume the plastic of the chip was beyond brittle and a bad formulation lacking plasticizer. Beyond brittle. They are cheap enough to just buy another brand or retry, but since the plastic is defectively brittle and fragile , I ordered a different leading brand.Most of my valid and VERY helpful verified purchase reviews are censored off of amazon, so I doubt this review will even be posted.BEWARE.... bad 2022.05 batch?
