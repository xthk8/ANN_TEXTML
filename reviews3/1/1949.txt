DON'T PURCHASE THESE.GE usually has been good to me but these are not it.If you purchase a 2 pack or any of the models with the flat plug, be warned. In my case, the 2 pack of 4 ft. surge protectors. There will be loose globs of solder bouncing around in your plug (both surge protectors + replacements) which could cause an electrical short, damaging your devices and in the worst case scenario, a fire.The packaging for the 2 pack also needs to be updated. They cram both surge protectors into a very thin cardboard box with nothing them so they get scraped by their respective plugs. You can see a lot of others mistake this for a used surge protector.If you want one that works in this listing, look at the image and make sure it's not a flat plug. I previously purchased the 3 ft. single pack with a regular plug and it's been perfect. The quality of the packaging is a lot higher so it can prevent damage during transit. There are no loose bits of solder and the housing was unscathed.
