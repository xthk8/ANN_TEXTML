I bought this product in May, it was delivered May 11th. The window to return closed June 10th. Conveniently when the window closes, 1 of the ear buds quit working. The right one charges & I see that it connects to the charge. When I put it in my ear it doesn’t say “connected” anymore nor can I hear sound. I have tried everything & it simply doesn’t work. I am extremely disappointed that these only lasted a month. I know I didn’t pay a whole lot for them, but you still expect something as simple as ear buds to work longer than a month no matter how much you pay. I’ve known people to spend $10 or less on ear buds work for years. I did give the sound quality 5 stars bc the quality of sound is just as good as air pods & your good ol Apple headphones that come with new iPhones. The battery life is excellent also bc i go for days without charging. Of course it always depends on how often you use them. You can talk on the phone with them & people can hear me really well. Even though you wouldn’t think so since the speakers are on the side of your head & you can’t move the mic closer to your face. You feel obligated to yell due to the distance of the mic to your mouth, but you don’t have to. The most important issue should be how long the item Lasts you though. That’s my biggest complaint & the fact that you can’t adjust the volume from the ear buds. If you tap on 1 of them it pauses the music, if you double tap it plays. If you take them out of your ears long enough the music pauses. If you can adjust the volume, I haven’t figured it out & I don’t typically read any instructions lol. (No telling what all I could truly learn if I read the booklets to my gadgets lol). Anyway, if it offers a warranty of some sort, buy it. I am not sure if it does.
