It doesn't matter if the microphone itself sounds OK or stands up to the competition if the supporting hardware required to use it is garbage and that is the case here.The so-called shock mount it comes with is a tiny piece of confoundingly brittle plastic that doesn't absorb any shock or vibration at all. It feels like it will snap every time you put the mic in it. I almost didn't buy this because so many so many people have reported it breaking for them under normal use. I can't carry it around and trust my work to it when I have this constant concern about it breaking based on how cheap and inflexible it is. If it breaks though, Movo will happily sell you a replacement on their web site for $12.95! This thing can't cost more than 5 cents to have manufactured in China and if you have to buy a replacement then you haven't saved any money over the Rode Videomicro which is much higher quality all around.The furry windscreen that comes with it is garbage too. It sheds and drops hairs like mad. I can't have it shedding in my camera bag leaving lose hairs all over my lenses!If I spend $40 or more on anything I expect all aspects of it to at least be better than dollar store quality, but unfortunately Movo really cut ALL corners here. Don't believe the YouTube reviewers who do side-by-side comparisons and say this mic is competitive, because with problems like these it clearly is not.
