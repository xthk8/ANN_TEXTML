My first time using this coveted film and I was extremely disappointed. Twice!!!!! Twice my film was ruined. 2/2 rolls TORE while I tried to rewind them. The first one I thought was my fault, but after it happened again I was livid. Two potential sets of photos on my Japan trip ruined due to the poor quality of this set. Iâ€™m afraid to use anymore and have my photos lost again.I expect a refund
