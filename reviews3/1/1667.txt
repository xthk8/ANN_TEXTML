I’ve order these before and so disappointed with the new ones. The speakers has change and are good but they are sewn in where the speakers can’t move which is nice. The problem is they are sewn so far back that only 1 speaker is on my ear while the other is behind my ear. Also, there will be no way to removed the speaker and charging area to wash the headband. BTW, I would say my head is average size.
