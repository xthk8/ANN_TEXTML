I thought this might be something a little nicer and sturdier to hold momentos for our babies. We have another one that's covered in canvas my wife had gotten years ago and I thought it would be similar. Nope. Save your money and just get a shoe box. It would probably be sturdier. PS- I'd return it but the price point isn't worth the hassle of returning.
