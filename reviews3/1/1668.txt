This head band is very thin which in return does not do well with the noise cancelation. It is also very loose on my head so unless you have a big head it won't fit right. The pictures also show it being used as a sleep mask. This is false the power button is right in the middle and if you try to use as a mask it's very uncomfortable. If you turn it around then the ear bids don't line up with your ears. I guess I got what I paid for with it being cheap.
