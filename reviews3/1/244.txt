Easily the worst cords I’ve bought from Amazon. None of them work reliably. I’ve tried them with different blocks and in different outlets and it’s definitely the cords. They won’t work for either of my ipad 9th gems and only work for my iPhone about 50% of the time. Idk if I just got a bad pack or what, but definitely a waste of money.
