Some of the reviews were a red flag but this product looked better than the others and I hoped my experience would be different. Unfortunately, the charger originally shipped did not work and I returned it for a replacement. But the replacement did not fare any better. Both chargers did not charge watch at all - even after 12 hours. In fact, they seemed to drain power and created such heat that I think it is a fire hazard. I tried the device with different charging blocks made by Apple and other manufacturers with same result -- no charge and extreme heat. My watch got so hot, I was concerned it might be permanently damaged. Thankfully, it still works and charges quickly with the original Apple charging cord. I can get a full charge in about 2-3 hrs. I hate having to travel with the long corded charger and this product appeared to offer an alternative. Regrettably, this product is not the answer. The only good thing I can say is that they were quick in sending me a replacement, and ultimately a full refund, but I wasted a lot of time trying this out. Hopefully, you don't have to waste yours.
