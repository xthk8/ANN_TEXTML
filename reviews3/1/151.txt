I really like this band and had the other sizes previously for Apple Watch 5,6,7. I got it for the Ultra and felt the same except for one major issue. The metal piece on the action button looks nice but when you bend your wrist and if your wrist touches the metal button it activates the action button. The button itself is not the issue but the metal housing around it. Amband please fix this and I would buy another.
