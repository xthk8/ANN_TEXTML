This did not work for me at all. I tried using this with a newer iPhone 14 Pro Max, running iOS 16.1. Nothing.I think its a software compatibility problem. Case in point - when I ditched this adaptor for the genuine Apple version ($55), a message popped up on my iPhone saying “please wait while we download the software needed to enable this accessory” (or something like that). I had to wait about 60-seconds and then the genuine Apple adapter worked great.I would not recommend buying this. Spend the money and get the genuine Apple version.
