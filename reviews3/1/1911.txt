I bought this for an upcoming extended trip to Italy. I wanted an extra long HDMI cord so when I watched TV from my laptop that was plugged into an HDMI outlet on the back of the TV, I wouldn't have to continually get up to fast-forward, pause, change what I'm watching. Used it for the first time less than a week ago. Already stopped working, less than a week old and had to switch it out for another backup HDMI cord that I brought. Had the backup cord for about three years with zero problems, and it's still working. The downside is that it's short. Do not waste your money on this cord, look elsewhere for a long cord. So disappointed!
