First I thought the plug wasn't securely in, so I tried again with a different outlet. Then I thought maybe it was the plug itself, and tried a different plug. Then I tried it again when the watch was half-charged and after a while, the watch showed that it was in the red zoneâ€”yes, people, this charger DE-CHARGED the watch. It has a short-circuit, evidently, and you should save your money and get a certified, reliable charger so you are not up a creek wen you need your watch to work! Also, fire hazard.
