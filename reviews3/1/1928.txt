The light itself is lovely. That’s about it. You see how in the picture on the product listing the phone holder points to the ceiling? You would think it would be easy to adjust this feature so that the phone points to you, but it’s not. I tried for two days to get this thing to actually face me, but could not get it. Doesn’t really matter if the light is lovely if it’s partially blocked by your phone.
