I waited some time to review this and after 2 weeks, I will be returning them. The sound is cracked and goes in and out. To connect them to my phone or laptop, it took multiple tries which got very frustrating sometimes. And these kept falling out my ears. I even tried different size plugs but that still didnâ€™t help! If you want beats, just get the new ones!
