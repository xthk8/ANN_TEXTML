The jack on one end of the cable no longer springs into place and keeps the cable snug. The attachment is not well made and without artificial means (duct tape), its pretty useless. I know the cable was cheap, but this is a record, lasting only 4 months. I should have rented it from Amazon. I do NOT recommend buying house brand electronics from Amazon. If I could rate it ZERO STARS, I would.
