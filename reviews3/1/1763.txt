Item was a bit of an impulse buy, so I didn't open it up to use until months after I bought it. It was sold as "Condition: Used - Like New". I did not think too much about it, focused more on the relatively low price. Anyway, now that I have finally used the label tape, I see that it prints as if all the label tape had been unspooled and then re-spooled backward, so that the tape prints purple on black. More importantly, though, the protective laminated part peels right off, along with the adhesive. As I use my label maker to label my cleaning bottles, not having the lamination makes the tape unusable for the purpose for which I mostly use it. The only option for product support when I checked on amazon.com was to contact Brother, which doesn't make sense since they didn't sell me defective used label tape. Lesson learned, I will need to check my purchases promptly upon receiving them.
