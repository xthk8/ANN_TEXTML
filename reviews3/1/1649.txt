So I loved this mic - it's awesome and for the price sound quality is stellar. But this morning I plugged it in to work on an audiobook and the light wouldn't turn on. Long story short, I finally opened it up only to find the micro USB port completely came off the circuit board, so now the entire mic is unusable. The weird part about this is I'VE ONLY HAD IT TWO MONTHS and I've never dropped it, I've never even unplugged the cord from the mic. It's either been on my desk or in a drawer specifically for the mic. I contacted the company and I'm waiting for them to get back to me.***UPDATE: When I originally got the product, I kept the manual but not the box. I believe the serial number is on a sticker on the outside of the box, which is required for all warranty claims. I'm going to try soldering the USB port back on, we'll see if that works.
