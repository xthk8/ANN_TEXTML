I bought this for my truck and was excited when it arrived as it seemed great. It installed easily and looked ok HOWEVER when i drove to work the following day i noticed it was vibrating/rattling around and my phone was shaking so i tried to tighten it up to no avail. Once i got home that day i tried to see what was causing it and i discovered the piece that adjusts the height up and down was poorly made and has a lot of play in it which was causing the problem. When i take my phone out it makes a really annoying rattle sound as well. Also my phone has fallen out onto the floor several times after hitting a pothole and YES it was in there tight. Overall i would say this is one of the worst things ive purchased on amazon so im returning it. STAY AWAY!
