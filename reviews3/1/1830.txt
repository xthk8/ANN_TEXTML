I bought this cable specifically because it was noted to be a USB-IF listed cable and documented to support 3A charging. The cable does *allow* 3A (60W) charging, however...I measured the resistance of the cable relative to the USB standards (for more information see the medium page from Benson Leung titled "What does it mean when a USB-C™ cable is rated at 3A?"). According to the specification, the wire resistance limit for supporting 3A/60W would be 0.166Ω for the voltage carrying line (Vbus/Vcc) and 0.0833Ω for the ground line.Fortunately, the value I measured for the 9 foot cable's ground line was under the 0.0833Ω limit, being 0.05Ω.Unfortunately, the value I measured for this cable's voltage carrying line was over the 0.166Ω limit at 0.227Ω. This would suggest that optimally (to keep the amount of voltage drop over the cable within the spec) this cable should be carrying no more than about 2.2A of current. That would make this cable optimal for something like a 45W load, but technically out of spec for a 60W load. The end result for any users connecting a 60W load would likely be slowed charging at maximum load.I would contrast this 9-foot cable's performance with
