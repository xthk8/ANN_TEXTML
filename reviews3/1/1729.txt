I had been using the .94" tape printing double lines and cutting them in half. I decided to make thing easier by purchasing the .47" which my device is capable of using as well. Product was received in standard sealed boxing. Once I removed it from the plastic sleeve I put it in the P-touch 2730. Everything was looking good so far. After I did my first test print I realized there was a problem. The tape was put together wrong internally. The "ink" strip was printing onto the clear plastic but was not adhering to the sticker backing. this made it come out as two different layers, one with a clear plastic backing with the printing on it and a negative version with the sticker half. I decided to open it up and see if it could be repaired. Bad idea. At this point he product could not be returned since pretty much all 4 spindles came undone when I opened it up. So the product was deemed unusable...and nonreturnable do to my own efforts at repair. My fault, but still annoying.
