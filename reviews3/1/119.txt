This particular sandisk micro sd card failed to format within my Tripltek tablet. When I took out the micro sd card it was so hot that it was burning my fingers. Will return it to Amazon and request a replacement and try again since I need this item. SSometimes a tiny percentage of manufactured items will not work. But I still have faith in Sandisk products which usually function correctly.
