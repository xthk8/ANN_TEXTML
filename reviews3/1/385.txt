Wow, complete disbelief. All was well, opened up the package, was pleased with the color choices. I removed my Apple Watch 44mm from the old case, washed it, cleaned it out, and prepped it for the new bands. Picked out the grey band to match my grey Whoop strap, and slid the band on to my watch. Then it all went horribly wrong. I decided the grey looked good, but I was going to be working in the shop and need the watch back in its protective case. Went to remove the grey strap....and nothing. The plastic pieces that slide into the watch grooves wouldn't budge. I tried pushing and pulling in both directions and finally one gave free. But the other one wouldn't budge. No matter what I did, how much pull/push I provided in either direction, the plastic slide would not release. I had to resort to using plyers to pull the slide directly out, at which point, half of the piece snapped off. And of course, the other piece still wouldn't release. I had to use a small screwdriver and the plyers to leverage the piece and pull it straight out. I finally got it out, with minimal damage to my watch.Now, this isn't some high tech piece of equipment. It is a band consisting of two plastic pieces that slide in and out of the watch. IF there is some sort of magical rain dance that has to occur to get them to release, then it died with the creator of the band, never to be known again. I tried every combination of pressure, slightly pulling out then trying, pushing in, then trying, pushing in the middle....EVERYTHING that would make since to apply the proper pressure for the slide to release. Nothing. I hate these straps so much that as soon as I got the pieces out of my watch, I initiated the return and started typing this review.
