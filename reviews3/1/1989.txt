They do not provide full description.I bought it in July 2022 and did not open the box for more than two months and when I opened in October 2022 it did not fit in 2020 Honda HRV; its a small charger and only meant for older car models. I thought it was my fault that I ordered wrong one. But today while checking reviews I realized to write my review. Be very careful whenever there comes a deal with such stuff. Charger is still in the car unused. Refund period is passed a long ago. Hope this helps other buyers.
