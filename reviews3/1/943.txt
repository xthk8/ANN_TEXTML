The description is misleading. The setup video is devoid of setup information but instead spends time on the instructors biography rather than instructions for use the microphone. After I realized that it is not iPhone compatible out of the box I went back to the reviews and noticed the manufacturer has absolutely no feedback on comments. None. Disappointed to find that they misrepresented compatibility on the site.
