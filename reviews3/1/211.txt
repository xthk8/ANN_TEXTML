UPDATE—fell off phone case within 18 days while it was just sitting on a table. The glue was completely separated from the base and on the phone case. Normally it would stick to base come off phone clean and you reapply. Was on a smooth plastic case that should be no problem.—————————————————————————Original review:Once you put this on, it has to stay where it is. Which is the opposite of how these usually work. If you move it, all the glue comes off Popsocket base and stays on the phone and glue gets wrinkled and piles on itself. The “cracks” you see in the pic are the glue piling on itself—the glue will not clean off the clear case, and leaves permanent marks on the case.It’s translucent not clear/transparent.NOT at all like other popsockets in sticking ability or move ability. Never experienced this before in all the years I’ve used many popsockets. Don’t waste your money on this one.
