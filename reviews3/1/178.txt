I bought the:WALI TVS001 Universal TV Stand Table Top for Most 22 to 65 inch LCD Flat Screen TV, VESA up to 800 by 400mm , 22 - 65 inchDefinitively, do NOT buy this product!! My tv is only 55 pounds and the Wali TV stand does not support its weight, as my TV tipped over and almost completely fell before I caught it! After installation and completely following directions, the legs do NOT even balance properly. How do you explain a "quality" product when it produces results such as this where the legs are so off balance?! (see picture)Overall, the product is NOT sturdy or stable AT ALL! You can literally touch it with your fingertip and it will fall over. Simply, I am lucky enough that my tv did not break! Would NOT recommend this product at all! If you check other reviews where the product is defective or faulty, you will see that the seller/producer "Wali" will hold refunds hostage by asking customers to change their star rating. I wish I had listened to these particular reviews and not bought this really cheap. flimsy product as it was a huge waste of my time.
