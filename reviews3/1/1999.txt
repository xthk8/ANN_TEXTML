I bought this product not realizing how easily removed the small magnets were. One of my children chewed through the soft plastic housing. Had she swallowed these 2 magnets, she would be at risk for a bowel perforation. As a pediatric emergency physician, I have taken care of these cases. I have thrown these all away as a safety hazard. If you have purchased these and have small children, I urge you not to buy these and to throw them away if you already have purchased them. No where in the product listing does it warn you of this hazard.
