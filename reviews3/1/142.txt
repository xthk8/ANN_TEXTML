So the 1st package I got from them was an empty box so had to spend time trying to get a refund. I finally get a watch band and it is cheap JUNK, Plastic clasp I immediately started my refund that I still have not received. I have invested more of my time into this then it was worth I would absolutely not recommend.So update as of 9/29/22. I am still dealing with this trying to get my refund on this junk. Because an empty box was mailed the return turned into a nightmare I have spent more time then this thing was even worth, I would steer clear of this seller. Amazon customer service has been great in handling it but the inconvenience of it all is silly considering you could clearly feel the weight was off the moment you pic up the packag.
