These are comfortable enough. They work similarly to every other version you’d find here on Amazon and elsewhere - but they are not durable. I’ve been wearing this black band for maybe 2 weeks since I received my shipment of 5 bands. It cracked within just a couple weeks! I never swam in this, and I baby my Apple Watch, so I’m not sure how it could have broken other than just being made cheaply. I can’t think of another brand that works better - but try those first. Avoid this brand if you can.
