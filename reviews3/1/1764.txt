I received one package of this tape with the PTD400AD label maker and then I also purchased an extra one since I expected to use quite a bit of it. To my disappointment, both of these particular width tapes had the same problem. In both instances the actual white "backing label" and the ink tape were feeding incorrectly. I also noticed that the pin that holds all the tapes in place broke in both of them as it feeds of I am not sure if it happened to be a bad lot since I did not experience this with the 3/4" or white on lime. I ended up throwing out the first cartridge, finding it that it would be beyond repair. Having said that, I looked up some videos on the web to determine any known issues with these cartridges. I came across a few videos that were helpful in helping me open the cartridge and feeding the tapes correctly. Thankfully, that worked and I was able to get at least the second cartridge to work somewhat. I still had to feed the tape out of the label maker since the pin was missing all together so the tape would try to feed within the unit. Pretty pricey waste!
