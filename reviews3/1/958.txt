I'm actually really sad that this didn't work. I got this mic for my mom and no matter what she did it did not work. It either didn't pick up sound or if it did her audio was really quiet. She also tried switching the wire around, taking the dead cat on and off, and still nothing. I'm really sad because we BOTH really wanted this to work. The mic came in good condition though.
