I am extremely disappointed in this item. It worked great until it didn't. I purchased it June 1 2022 and it broke completely October 26 2022. In the last month of use I noticed the arm was failing to hold its position, most likely the inner metal rod was snapping slowly. It was lightly used daily, as I'd put my phone in it to charge overnight or hold it while watching a show. I'm very bummed out.
