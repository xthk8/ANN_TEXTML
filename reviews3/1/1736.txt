Â Sometimes you think you'll save some money and it ends up costing you more in the long run. In this case, it cost me my label maker! After putting this cartridge in and attempting to print my first label with it, it jammed up inside the label maker and completely destroyed my label maker. Now it no longer works and I'm out the cost of a label maker that worked perfectly before. You can't always trust that you are getting a good deal. I would pay the extra few dollars and buy one at the local office supply store next time.
