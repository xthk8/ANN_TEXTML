Bought 1, insufficient light even with a ring light. So bought another. Light is decent but battery is horrible. It takes apx 5hrs to charge and gives apx 1.5hrs of battery. They usually fail before I've finished my show. Also they provide only a usb charging cable but not an actual adapter for the wall socket. I'm now trying to find a 4th light that is a plug in because these are a waste of time, electricity and money.
