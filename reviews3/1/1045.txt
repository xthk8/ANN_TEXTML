This would have been a good headset with good battery life etc.. BUT every time i press the mute button the built in announcer voice (a bad idea to start with) says "mute off" (or on) to me and sends a blast of static to everyone else in the meeting. It's a heavily distorted version of the announcement. It seems to be caused by inadequate electrical isolation between the announcement circuit and the microphone circuit, allowing major electrical crosstalk and heavy distortion during the announcement. This is not a manufacturing defect, it's a design flaw! Should have had a muted LED or hot mic LED instead. Also the volume control buttons feel good physically but again are ruined by crappy design work and performance. This unit goes in the trash and I'll look for another brand designed by competent electrical engineers.
