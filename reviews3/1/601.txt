The stand is much too light and CONSTANTLY falls over with your phone sitting on it because it’s simply made too lightweight and cheaply.Instead, I recommend the Adjustable Cell Phone Stand, OMOTON C2 Aluminum Desktop Phone Holder Dock, which is adjustable, well made, and heavy enough construction so that it doesn’t fall over putting your phone screen at risk.
