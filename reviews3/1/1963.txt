 I’ve been waking up from a deep sleep with flashing lights because this thing randomly turns on when powered OFF. It must be a wiring issue. It’s like the switch is too sensitive or something but even when it’s turned off it somehow manages to “barely” power on which creates a strobe light flashing effect that is annoying. MI want to like this product but you get what you pay for like they say.
