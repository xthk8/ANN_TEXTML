I've been using this plug for about a month now. I have noticed that it gets hot, but this is nothing surprising with chargers. I have been hearing weird buzzing coming from around the outlet but I've been ignoring it. Today I realized the buzzing was louder than normal. I checked and saw it was coming from the outlet. The buzzing stopped when I unplugged the port and returned when I plugged it into a new outlet. Certainly its the black port that the electrical sound is coming from. Must be a loose wire in there. It is hot to touch. I took the usb-A cable out of the port and had to pull my thumb back from the metal because it was burning hot. I genuinely fear if I left the port it may have started some fire. This port is dangerous. I should never buy something cheap like this every again. I got what I paid for, now I have to throw it away.
