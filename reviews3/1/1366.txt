I have purchased these product many times but this time I have a lemon. The toner or the drum or both started leaking toner onto my paper after only a few hundred sheets of paper were run through the printer.I had to throw away both the drum and the toner to make sure I didn't have a continued problem. It was a mess. I lost over $200.00 worth of products due to faulty materials or workmanship. That is not funny.I need to know for sure what company is sending these defective products so that I can never use them again.
