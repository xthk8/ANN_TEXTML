I have used laminating pouches for years. I have never had this issue. About one in 4 sheets the laminate doesn’t stick and peels up, bubbles and ruins what your laminating. Even with a second time though laminator doesn’t help. It doesn’t seem to matter what the item being laminated is either as I laminated a ton of sheets before I realized the problem.
