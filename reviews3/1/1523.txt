I would give this 5/5 stars in all categories if not for it breaking off the adhesive after not even 2 weeks of continuous use. It was super cute and the adhesive STICKS but the part that is supposed to go through your hands broke off the base and there is no way to repair it. I had bought a very cute phone case too and after the pop socket broke I removed it the adhesive took a good part of my case decals with it. Cute to look at but will damage your case and not last. Would give 0 stars if I could now.
