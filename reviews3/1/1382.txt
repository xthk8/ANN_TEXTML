3rd time I've purchased the brand of ink for my printer and the 3rd time the ink fails. After cleaning, which also uses up the ink, I get a few more pages and a cleaning is required again. Most of this ink goes to cleaning. I'm going back to the generic inks. They last a lot longer with only the initial cleaning. More bang for less bucks.
