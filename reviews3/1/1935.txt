The cardboard to make these is thinner than most shoeboxes. The finish is slick and shows any dents or scratches. The metal window on the front is crooked. You’d be better off buying a similar box from target or Joann’s, these are just a cheap version of regular photo boxes. I hate that Amazon has become so shady with the quality of products they offer. Such a waste.
