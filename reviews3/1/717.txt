Order these headphones, only to have a major sound issue while using them paired as Bluetooth. Tried everything I could, and then went to contact tech support...Only to find that they are M-F during standard business hours only. Completely useless if you have a M-F job during all standard business hours.If you are going to have M-F tech support, they need to be open until for at least 12 hours, so that users in ANY state can get in touch after work (or before work). Being open for less than 12 hours M-F simply is not acceptable. In this case, I get home about 5 minutes before they close, and leave for work 10 minutes after they open (yay commute), because they are only open for a 10h45m window.Alternately, you should be open for at least partial hours on either Sat or Sun, so that M-F workers can contact you.Since I cannot contact tech support outside of the incredibly slow process that is email correspondence, I'm forced to return these and go with another brand product.
