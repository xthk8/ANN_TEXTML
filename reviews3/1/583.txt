I have had another company's metal tips, but wanted to get these since they were a little cheaper, and it was a bad idea. They are horribly made and make a scratching noise when I use them on my iPad, which has a paper feel screen protector. They don't look right on the pencil, like someone got the measurements wrong for it to look cohesive. Not a good purchase.
