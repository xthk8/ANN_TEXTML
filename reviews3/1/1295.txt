This product overheated immediately. My phone gave the sound indicator that it was charging... then not charging, then charging repeatedly clicking on and off, which prompted me to check the cord and unit which was extremely hot. Like burn your house down sort of hot!.. I have been trying to do a return but even tho it says it's returnable, and amazon allows me to start the return process, the 'continue' button in the return process does not allow me to complete the process. I guess i will have to go through the pain in the ass process of finding Amazon's number, which should be easy but somehow they make it difficult ....and calling it in. - remind me to write the number down this time! :-)
