I will never purchase this item again. My printer shows message that cartridge is without ink!!!!I just purchased this from you in May and installed the day received. I have not printed more then a couple dozen copies with these cartridges. It is for home use and I am just an OLD Lady that likes to print out my orders from you and my E mail cards and and occasional E-Mail from my Great Grand sons. That is not much use for $42.00 You now tell me that it is not returnable . This old lady is NOT HAPPY!!! Marie Ritch
