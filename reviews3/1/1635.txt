This worked great the first camping trip I used it for - filled up a couple air mattresses easily. The second trip I took it on was not so great. It worked once to blow up an air mattress and when we went to use it the next night to add more air in the mattress, the light was red, would flash blue for a second and then back to red. Never got it to work again. Very disappointed.
