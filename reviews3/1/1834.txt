During the third time using this charging cable, it caught fire overnight, melted, and damaged the charging port of my cell phone to beyond repair. My phone can no longer charge and is unusable. Thankfully nothing else in the room caught on fire during the incident, or I would be trying to recoup much more than a fried phone.Amazon's response to the safety hazard has been lackluster as well. I've now been calling since August and am now on my fifth call to Customer Service with wasted hours and a reimbursed purchase to show for it. No offer of replacing the phone damaged by their product has been made in any way, only vague apologies and redundant gathering of background information.Every Customer Service rep has been pleasant and done the best they can, but the lack of any real action from Product Safety and the Leadership teams has been annoying and inefficient. Maybe they're unresponsive because they're inundated with other complaints about faulty products? I held off on writing this review in hopes that everything could be resolved, but that has unfortunately not been the case.
