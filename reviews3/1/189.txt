I had high hope for this phone holder mount, based on these great reviews for the product, and based on my past experience with the great iPhone holder mounts made by Lamicall. Thinking that how wonderful it would me to install this on my night stand and enjoy viewing my iphone hand-free while lying on my bed. Unfortunately reality was sometime cruel. There are flaws with the design of this flexible mount, it was very difficult to mount it on my night stand since there were really not enough extended surface area at the top of my night stand, then the bottom of its flexible arm could not be rotated, therefore once mounted, its flexible arm could not be rotated to the right angle. However, the major flaw of this product is that (1) Its arm is very rigid and inflexible, therefore very difficult to bend into the right direction; (2) Made it worse, its arm is too short, after it was secured to the top of my left night stand, basically, it was not long enough for it to be placed directly in front of me, but rather I had to lie on my right side to view it. In short, it was basically useless and I had no choice but to return to Amazon.com At least Amazon.com is great with return and have great customer service. They need to design a longer and most flexible arm, even at higher cost, this holder mount is nothing flexible and too bulky. You would better off just hold your phone with our hands, IMHO.
