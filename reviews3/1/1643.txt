This started out as a decent microphone, I was always a little disappointed with how it sounded, but I thought it was a decent deal.Unfortunately the microphone seems to have died after 2 short years (making a horrible buzzing sound with a distorted voice). I personally expected the microphone to hold up a little better, and I'm disappointed that I haven't heard back from support at all about possible troubleshooting steps. This microphone may not last very long, and it may be worth getting something a little higher quality.
