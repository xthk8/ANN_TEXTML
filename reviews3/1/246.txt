READ THE REVIEWS - this is my 2nd set of “fast charging” cord purchases here on Amazon in as many days that advertise fast charging, but absolutely do not deliver. I bought these because they were wonderfully long and cheap but did not read the reviews, and wouldn’t you know the first review shows the actual electrical stats and nope. No fast charging.I only found this out myself tonight when after six hours of being plugged in my iPad Pro was only charged at 47 percent. And only then did I read the reviews. Bah.I’m now going to purchase the actual Apple brand which is half the length and three times the price, but at least it delivers.
