So I ordered this to go with the Ulanzi ST-03 cell phone mount for tripod (WHICH I LOVE!). I don't understand how you can make such a great mount and have such BAD quality control for the LED Video light. So I ordered one with mount, first one arrived and one of the LEDs was bad...QC sticker in the box, figured ok maybe one bad one slipped out. Returned to Amazon and had them ship me a new unit. It arrived today with TWO BAD LEDs!! QC sticker in the box again. Who's checking these a blind guy? I'm not going to trust ordering a 3rd one. I'll try a different brand. QC guy you had one job!
