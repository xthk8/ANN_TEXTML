EDIT: Downgrading this rating to 1 star. So I broke down and replaced the first broken set with another set of the exact same model. Other than breaking in the first six months, I liked the set overall and I was willing to write the breakage off as a fluke. Having a left-side mic was a must for me and the newer Jabra models didn't seem to have that feature. And then today the new set $%^* broke in the exact. same. spot. And it's been just about 6 months on this set as well. Because the earcups are rotatable, there is only a 5mm spot where the ear cup connects to the headpiece. And that's what is breaking. I never got anywhere with Amazon Fresh on the first broken pair, so I'm not going to waste my time trying to get Amazon to do something about this broken pair. I'm replacing this set with a Plantronics Voyager Focus. I'm done with Jabra.I bought this headset in late May because I needed good call quality for working from home. I actually liked it quite a bit.. (the connectivity via dongle was lovely and I never had any issue with call quality) until this morning when the left ear cup (with the mic) came off while I was on a call, Admittedly, I used it for 8-6 hours a day most days, but if I pay this much for a headset from a known leader in the market, I expect more than 6 months of use. It's after the 30-day return window, so Amazon support won't do a darned thing.. they directed me to the seller: Amazon Fresh. (so Amazon Fresh isn't Amazon?!) but I doubt that I won't get anywhere with them either.
