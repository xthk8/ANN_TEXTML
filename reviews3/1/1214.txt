Headset works great. But when the battery won't charge anymore, and needs to be replaced (happens with all of the (Plantronic CS540) it is impossible to find the right battery. The regular CS540 battery doesn't fit. Via lots of trying to find them, I determined that this battery is a European version of the CS540, called the CS540A. I have not been able to find it anywhere, and I suspect that if I can find it, it will be much more costly than the ones that I can get in the US, since it probably has to ship from Europe. If you're looking for the Plantronic CS540, make sure you check the battery when you get it and if it has 3 cells instead of 2, return the item immediately.
