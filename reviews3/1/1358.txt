Love the main body of this but not happy with it over all. Don't know how the suction mount works because it won't work w/ my dash and don't have a good spot to put on the windshield out of the way.My issue is the vent clip - I loved at first so a few weeks later I bought a 2nd of these but after a couple months of use both vent clips have failed. Something inside the clip fails and it won't keep pressure on the vent. I tried adding a couple lock washers between the tension wing-nut and the clip but it just doesn't hold up very long so in a few weeks the clip spreads and won't stay on the vent. Not sure if it's just a bad design or poor quality of materials that are being used.It really should have more room between the tension nut for the vent clip and nut to tighten the ball on the back of the main body so that you have room to get them set at the right angles and still be able to tighten them.
