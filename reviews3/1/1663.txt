This piece of fabric and wires is… a lot, and nothing at all. I pressed my finger against the box to turn on the device and it completely misplaced the box, pulling out a small bit of wire with it. It cannot fit back inside of the headband. Off to a great start.When you put it on, it’s even better. A thin piece of fabric with a giant box smashed directly into the middle of your forehead, and two ear pieces that sit perfectly behind your ears. And when you decide you finally want to play music… it makes a horrible small popping noise. Just enough to make you want to rip this thing off, destroy it entirely, and just play your music or white noise through an Alexa.If I were you, I’d just go with the competition, or just a Bluetooth speaker!
