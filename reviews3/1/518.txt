Oh, how the mighty have fallen. These were excellent when I bought them, but have already started to give me trouble. They drop out randomly. Before they started doing this they were excellent. They look new. Look great and have been well taken care of. Very unfortunate. For this they lose 3 stars. Here's the original review I wrote:These aren't at the level of my Planer head phones but then the cord for those head phones cost 4x as much as these headphones. These are incredible for the price. That's not a off handed insult, at all. They're excellent. They sync well with my laptop and youtube videos. I love the quality. I cannot hear my 70db Air Conditioner with them on -- just beautiful music.They are a bit bass heavy, but not muddy. They have a rich sound that can play anything. I don't know any at this price point that are anywhere near this quality -- if they last. I'll write and let you know if they don't. Right now I love them -- be sure you charge them 8 hours before using them the first time as is said in the manual.They're also comfortable.EDIT:Now they don't work and I regret ever buying them. What a rip off! When I was a kid people didn't sell stuff that broke for no reason. I'm disgusted.
