I bought these 12/16/23 and as of today 1/24/23 not a single one works. Several didn’t work straight out the pack, I would plug them in and my phone would just not charge. The last one which I’m using now semi worked but is now doing the same thing. I need new chargers all over again, don’t waste your money
