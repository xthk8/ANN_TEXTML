Arrived quickly and seemed to be good quality. However after less than 30 days of light use I’ve already have had a cord go bad.I haven’t been able to find any damage to the effected cord itself. I was driving when suddenly my phone disconnected from my truck. Tried disconnecting and reconnecting the cord several times over the next few days. As soon as I plugged in a new cord, my phone charged just fine.At this point I have no idea how long this pack of cords will last but if it’s anything like the first cord I used, it won’t be long
