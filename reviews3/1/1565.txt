This is a well constructed Item (if it worked properly) . with incomprehensible Assembly Instructions/Diagrams. Havingused the correct screws and spacers to mount vertical brackets to TV, when fully assembled , the TV flares outward. It does not stand vertically at 90 degrees, and instructions do not permit any VERTICAL angle adjustmentI called the Support Telephone Number listed in the booklet. You can't talk to anyone. I was only allowed to leave my telephone number for a call back. No one called back. I sent e-mail-no response. I called Amazon for support, and was told they could not help, but, “will call back.” No one called back. I called again and was only offered a refund. Despite the Amazon Support link for tech support, both Phillipines agents who could not communicate in English, only offered a refund. They specifically stated they could provide no tech support.I will keep the item and call a technician at my expense to fix this. It is a matter of getting the right length screws/spacers. That's all. I do not recommend this product. Buy similar product at a local retail store and have it installed by a competent technician in your area. Amazon for something like this is a Deal Breaker big time.
