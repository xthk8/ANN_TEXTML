I bought this as a replacement to an older Plantronics voyager 5200 that had worked well for several years but started to get a little odd with the on/off buttons. I expected this device to work well. Almost immediately after pairing the device with my Samsung S9 and iPhone 8 I started noticing weird behavior. Every time I turned on the headset it would beep and blip at me over and over. I eventually learned to "reset the sensors." It takes 3 or 4 rounds of resetting the sensors to get the headset to pair with my phones without a whole host of crazy behavior. During that time it tries repeatedly to redial the last number called. I've had to apologize to my boss and my parents for accidentally calling them at 6 am when I got in my car to go to work! I tried turning off the sensors in the Plantronics hub but they keep turning themselves back on. Every single time I try to use this headset I have to reset the sensors 3 of 4 times just to get it to pair; and eventually after successfully pairing, on my drive to work, the headset will randomly unpair and become unusable (sometimes during the middle of a phone call!). The whole point behind this device is to be safe "hands free" device. When all this chaos is happening while I'm trying to drive (redials, resets, suddenly losing the pairing) it makes this device down right dangerous. Beware! I think the concept of these sensors is a neat idea but the implementation of the technology is seriously flawed and makes this a dangerous "hands free" device.
