This was attached to my desk and I only use it every 3-4 weeks for product photography, for about an hour each time. From that minimal use, it broke. It started as a slow droop, then completely fell. The arm became disjointed from the base and it just swivels around, will not hold my phone up anymore. Very disappointed by the quality.The only thing positive is the clamp has padding to protect phone, so it doesn't scratch the screen, and it was large enough to mount a Galaxy 22 Ultra.
