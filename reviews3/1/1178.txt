So I bought this to use on a desk phone but the calls are driven by software on my computer. In this scenario no lifter is needed but for calls to work the headset needs to be on (via the hard button on headset).The software will always deliver the calls but you won't know unless you've turn on the headset. This is an annoyance since that means the battery will always be in use. I've had this make it through a 10 hour day and also fail to make it though the same 10 hour day, heck the battery has even ran out on a 5 hour day. We're not talking about multi hour calls. Short calls and mostly 7 minutes or less but it needs to be on or you can't communicate with incoming calls.This unit does get turned off and put back on charger for meetings, breaks and end of shift. Between the hard thin plastic of the ear hook and the unpredictable battery life this is going back. Audio is so so and nothing to write home about.
