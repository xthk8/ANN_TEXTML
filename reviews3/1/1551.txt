I was hoping that these would fit more comfortably in my ears than the supplied Airpod Pro 2 tips. They did not; the fit was about the same, and they slowly worked their way out just like the normal AIrpod Pro tips when eating, talking, etc.The huge problem with the Comply tips is one of usability. Inserting the Airpod Pro tips is just a matter of sticking them in with one hand (or glove); the Comply tips require two hands (without gloves) to press down, then several more seconds EACH to wait for the foam to expand while holding them in the ear canal. If you don't get them in the right position, then you need to remove and repeat. Getting them inserted takes a good 30 seconds using both hands. If one should slip out or you need to remove it for a moment, then you have to repeat the two-handed process to get them in again. This is the worst feature and reason enough not to use Comply tips.The second worst feature is that the Airpod Pro 2s do not recognize the Comply tips when inserted in the ear and will not activate noise cancellation. The Ear Tip Fit Test on my iphone reports that they fit properly.I gave up on the Comply tips after 2 days. They are infuriating to use and negate the most important feature of the Airpod Pro 2s.
