Crap connectors for both the usb-c and lighting end. Either the detents on the side of the lightning connector or the width of the connector itself are not manufactured correctly causing the cord to feel very loose inside the phone and letting it come out very easily. The USB-C connector has seemingly the opposite problem requiring a worrisome amount of force to push into the charging source. All 3 in the pack had the issue, so I can't imagine it was a fluke.I'll keep them as backups since they """work""" and it was only a few bucks anyway, but my god spend some more $$$ if you're looking for a quality cable. Gone are the days when I could drop my phone between my bed and the wall and be able to pull it up by the cord :'(
