These sheets did not work well for us. Our kids had a project for school which required photos to be glued onto regular paper to make a collage. When we were done glueing everything into place, we laminated the sheet. Well, it turned out terrible and wrinkly. We had to reorder photos and redo the project, figuring it was too thick in some areas we made sure to only layout in a single layer, overlapping only in a few areas. It still came out the same way. It is hard to see in the pictures Iâ€™ve attached but there were bubbles everywhere and around the perimeter of regular printer paper with some photos on it, the plastic sheet did not seal well so when we trimmed off the excess, it started to delaminate. We were pretty upset that at this point we have done it twice only to get the same result. Also, I would like to note that we have used other brands that were cheaper and never had this problem with the actual laminating machine which made us come to the conclusion that these sheets probably only work for single sheet laminating. If you plan on adhering anything to regular copy paper, I would recommend to use another brand. Hope this helps somebody else avoid as much frustration as we did.
