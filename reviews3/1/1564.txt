DO NOT BUY THIS TV STAND! My brand new 50‚Äù LG arrived this week along with my brand new Roku Streambar Pro. The TV weighs approximately 25 lb. I put the TV stand together according to the instructions on a Thursday night (July 8, 2021) and placed the TV and soundbar on my dresser. On Saturday morning (July 10, 2021), I heard a huge crash from my loft. I walked into my bedroom and saw my brand new TV laying on the floor, my soundbar upside down, and glass all over my floor. Please see pictures for the damage. Thank goodness my children and pets were not around when it happened. It also damaged my wall and I scratched my hand while picking up the shards of glass. I reported the incident to Amazon and they are conducting an investigation. I will also contact the company and the Consumer Product Safety Commission on Monday. I want my brand new TV and soundbar replaced!Update: The company reimbursed me for my TV and soundbar, which I very much appreciated.
