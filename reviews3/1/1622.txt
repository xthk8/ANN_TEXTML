These work great and sound quality is very good when they stay in your ear. They sync very well with my Samsung watch for volume and track control. Unfortunately for me, they keep popping out or falling out. I have tried all the rubber tips that came with it. Same result. They are also very slippery to handle. I have dropped them a few times already. Battery life is very good. I have used them on long flights and the noise cancellation works very well even without any music playing. I have misplaced all the packaging so I will have to keep them for now....
