I use this to connect my desk monitor to my Surface via a Microsoft hub. In December the cable suddenly died. I tried it on other devices and confirmed it was the cable.On December 16th I ordered another one same day delivery because I use this for work, and today just two weeks later, this one died too. The same way. Just died. I get that they're only $8, but it was just sitting plugged in, I didnt even move it let alone yank on it or damage it in any way. Theres no reason this cable should have such a short lifespan.
