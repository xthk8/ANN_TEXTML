I'll start with the good news.- The earphones are very comfortable and they feel solidly built.- I'm not an audiophile, but it sounds okay to me.So now the negatives (at least for me)- They don't have separate buttons for volume and prev/next navigation. To get prev/next functionality, you need to long press the buttons. As a podcast listener, I use navigation frequently and I often want to hit the button a few times to back up a bit, so having it require a long press is a major drawback to me.- There is a noticeable lag which makes them unusable for listening to the audio portion of a videos. You see mouths moving, then the voice follows a half-second later. I haven't seen a Bluetooth headphone with sync issues for at least 10 years.- The Play/pause button isn't easy to find. Basically you need to hit the left side of a small bar that isn't raised much. If you hit the right side of the bar, it does nothing. I'll probably get used to it, but why not have a smaller, raised button that just works all over.- The noise-cancelling barely works. There is actually a lawnmower running as I write this so I can test it against their advertised use case. The results were underwhelming. Switching on the feature takes some of the bass out, but the noise's overall volume isn't changed much. And it's still very noticeable. Given the price, I wasn't expecting much. But if you think you are getting something like the Bose headphones, think again.
