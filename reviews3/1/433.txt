If you are looking for a laminate to do a whole sheet then it’s fine even though the edges may curl because it did for me for some. I am a preschool teacher and so I need to cut things out and laminate them the laminating sheet did not cling to the paper so the paper would move and I would have to redo it and or it would get jammed in my laminating machine. It’s so much thinner than other brands that I have used also definitely will not be buying this again.
