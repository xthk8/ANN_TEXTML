I bought this TN-880 (12,000 pages) so I would not have to buy another toner for a while. After much less than half way through the expected number of pages the copies started coming out with random smudges of ink on them. Multiple attempts at cleaning the drum, fuser, etc. were futile. Also, telephoned Brother and during a one-hour call followed all of their instructions to fix the problem. The issue was escalated and the higher level of support finally acknowledged the toner was defective and leaking. But, Brother was not responsible for it any longer since the warranty was only for 90 days from the date of purchase. I will just have to buy another "Brother" toner, he said. This toner was bought for home use and the 90 day warranty is pretty much a farce. Nobody I know prints 12,000 pages every three months at home.
