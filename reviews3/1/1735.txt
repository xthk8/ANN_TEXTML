This is advertised to contain more than 26' of tape. I purchased two, installed one and immediately printed 10-15 identical 5” labels (to add to some I had printed when my previous tape ran out). To my shock, the new tape ran out in a little more than a minute, if that. I don’t know how many labels I printed; but, including the identical tapes I had printed from the previous cassette, I had 23 tapes (a total of less than 10’ of tape—not all from this cassette. I have used several of these tape cassettes over several years with total satisfaction. They are expensive and entering text is slow, but I very much like the finished product.I wondered if these were counterfeit “knock offs,” but the packaging and end product seemed consistent with past experiences. Perhaps it was a one-of quality control problem. But based on this experience, I can’t give it a high rating.
