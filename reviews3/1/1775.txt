For an item that doesn't get banged around at all, or even moved at all, it sure did break pretty quickly.My roommate's just sits in their car and mine was in my backpack side pouch. Oddly enough, as much as mine got banged around and moved and hung from rear view mirrors while my roommate's remained motionless and gentled, theirs broke within days and mine began to act up about two weeks later.This is not the first story I could tell like this so, to give this company some credit, this device design itself may just be gimpy. I can't say that THIS particular one sucks any more than the last two that broke on us but I can just say that it didn't last very long at all. Worked very well until it didn't, I'll say that also.
