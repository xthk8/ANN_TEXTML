In less than six months the headphones would not take or hold a charge. the same cable and charger were used the whole time and still work with other devices. The volume buttons are oddly placed and and when pressed take time to effect a change. The ear pads are very comfortable and they sound is very good for the price. Very disappointed in the lack of effort to replace by amazon.
