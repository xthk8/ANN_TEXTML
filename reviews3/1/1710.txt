I love having a box to hide my power strip in! But this has a bad design. For one thing, the lid doesn't come off easily or go back on easily. And you kind of want that, because sometimes you need to access your power strip. Every time I have to open this, it's a struggle. I have so many broken nails from it, and I keep my nails short. This is just a very poor design.Also, the power strip fits into it awkwardly because of where the cord comes out.Update: I HATE THIS THING!! It's impossible to open, and if you do manage it, all the cords fly out and have to be rearranged. This is the worst designed thing ever.
