I bought this because I needed the vent clip for my current car and the dash mount for a future car. I currently use a CD player mount that tends to work its way out of the CD slot when I drive on bumpy roads. I thought the one button phone release would be a nice feature so I wouldn’t have to wrestle with the clamp to put my phone in the holder and then wrestle with it to get my phone back. Well, the vent clip was worse than the CD slot holder. I didn’t even have to drive on bumpy roads for it to work its way loose. After 2 days, I went back to my CD slot holder. I haven’t tried the dash mount because I’ll be replacing my car soon and didn’t want to waste the adhesive pad on my current car.
