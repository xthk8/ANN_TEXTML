I bought these for my kids’ stockings for Christmas, they go through headphones like there’s no tomorrow. Firstly, they are advertised as Apple, they are NOT Apple. They are flimsy and light, didn’t come in any packaging besides a plastic baggie, I can’t believe they survived shipping. My 15 year old son is always talking on his phone to friends and he said they’re terrible for calls. Don’t buy, total waste of money.
