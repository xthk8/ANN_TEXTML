I've used this headset for a year now, plenty enough time to give it an honest review. I'm currently looking for a replacement. I love the style of this product, but thats about where it stops. The ear clip is small and brittle. They give you two, but neither fit well. I did away with them within the first two weeks. The rubber ear pieces (which can be used without the clip and come in many sizes) stay in the ear ok, but they don't stay connected to the device well, so eventually (and semi-frequently) it will fall out and you'll be left with the rubber piece still in your ear and the device on the ground. The volume on the device is also too finicky. There are two adjustments - general volume, and mic/speaker gain (on the base). Most of the volume options are far too quiet. Once you finally get a good volume in the ear, the mic will feedback. It also distorts very easily and I've just accepted that calls will be uncomfortably quiet. I've put up with all of this until the most recent issue, though. After about 15 mins of use the mic will randomly start feeding back in your ear. The callers on the other end can hear it too. If you can push through that, eventually the ear piece will shut off and start screeching. The only way to fix it to put it back on the charger for a few minutes. It didn't do this at first, but now its almost unusable. The whole reason you want this thing is for calls LONGER than 15 mins. I typically like Plantronics products, but I can't recommend this one. It's a great looking device with far too many flaws.
