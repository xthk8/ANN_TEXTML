The first time we used it, it used the iPhones built in mic after doing 3 sound checks. Doesn’t sound like a big deal but a 15 minute training video with power point slides without mistakes is extremely hard to do. When we listened and discovered it didn’t use the mic on the 3rd attempt that was perfect with no mistakes, our heart broke knowing we just wasted an hour and had no idea if we could do it again. It said it was connected and the green light was on so it should have worked but didn’t! We had had no choice but to try again and it did work but took way longer because it took another 3 takes. So I wouldn’t waste your time on the cheapest mic on Amazon if you want it to work when needed! Also you can see the pic what it looks like if you drop it. I thought when I snapped it back together it would work but it didn’t so it’s basically disposable. Not worth buying if it’s so cheaply made it explodes from dropping it. And ruins your perfect take because it never switched mics…
