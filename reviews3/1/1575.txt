Do NOT buy this unit. I bought it from Best Buy after misplacing a Plantronics Voyager Legend model which is $60 cheaper. I eventually FOUND the Legend model and started comparing the two. My first impression of the Voyager 5220 an even MORE advanced (translation: More EXPENSIVE model) is that it did not work as well as the less costly Legend model. Both were marginal as far as people hearing me through the microphone and my ability to get a clear audible signal from the ear piece. The dramatic, almost DOUBLE priced 5200 series is a WASTE of extra money as the lower cost unit works BETTER. Even WORSE, I started looking at other Blue tooth earpieces on Amazon and found a lowly $33 Ansin unit that got STELLAR 5 star ratings across the board, 150 reviews. Here is a link to it: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0747Y9NK9/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1I ordered it, it fits the ear MUCH easier and FAR less tendency to fall off so fit is MUCH better than Plantronics. Also NO long boom microphone to swing up and down and catch on things and people I talk to can hear me BETTER than with the two far more costly Plantronics units. So, save your money, don't be fooled by fancy prices and the Plantronics name. All Plantronics wants is your M O N E Y. For $33, this Ansin unit, as the reader comments indicate, BLOWS AWAY the rip off Plantronics units. Hope this helps someone avoid getting ripped off by a LOUSY company. Oh, and their tech support is USELESS. Their phone answering people do not have enough knowledge to help you. All they do is read from a script and repeat the same things over and over. For $33, who cares what Ansin's customer service does. For that price its not as much of risk, PLUS THIS UNIT WORKS FAR BETTER!!
