It did not work for very long. I used in guest bedroom and had lamp and tv plugged in. I had a shorter power strip in place for a very long time but decided to change and include one with usb connections. This worked when I first plugged it in. When guest went to plug in usb cord a few weeks after purchase that is when we realized it was no longer working.
