I really wanted to like these and the two spots that I go to for reading reviews are the 5 star and 1 star. Nothing in between. Of course all of the 5’s rave about how great the product is but I also like to read the 1’s to get the dirt on the product too and here I am… 1 star. The blue 6 foot cable was bought on April 18. Here it is May 22 only 4 days past the 30 day return window and I’m beat. I preach to my entire family on how to not abuse all of these cheap charging cables in general. Do not bend the wire sharply at the connector at the phone, do not yank the wire from the middle somewhere to disconnect it from the phone and instead grasp it from the connector at the end of the wire. I do all of this yet it still stopped working in just under 5 weeks. Everything is made to break quickly these days and we all just keep spending and spending. It’s disappointing…
