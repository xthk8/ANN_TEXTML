The instructions are on one small piece of paper, and really don't explain anything. This is supposed to be a surge protector, but no where in the instructions does it say to how many joules this product protects.I do wonder if the manufacturer has any kind of quality control.Our of the package I thought at first that I did a mistake, and turned one of the switches off, when I didn't get any power to the USB ports, but no it was for sure not my fault. I even got hubby to help, even though I didn't need his help. I reset the whole tower several times, and suddenly the light on top started to flicker each time I plugged and unplugged the whole tower. If I shake it, and am lucky, I will get power to the light on top and the USB ports (the little blue light between the ports is then actually on), but putting the tower down again might ruin this success. There's no on and off switch to the ports like there's the the power plugs. What ever connects the night light on top with the USB ports has a problem.I'm actually afraid that this thing will catch on fire, since it really only works properly when you shake it first, therefore I'm going to return it.
