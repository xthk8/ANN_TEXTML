HDCP videos do not work on it. I purchased to view videos from my iphone and to cast to the TV. no matter what the setting, it played videos at 0.5x speed. Unwatchable. Youtube worked fine, but there's a youtube app for smart TVs. Screen Mirroring worked fine, but I find that feature useless when it can't mirror videos at normal speed.
