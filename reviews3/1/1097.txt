I have Windows 7. I had to disable your antivirus protection to install the drivers. Installation was successful, but I lost certain functions. The taskbar is normally a bit transparent albeit a bit blurry, but mine went solid and I couldn't see the thumbnail preview for taskbar items, i.e. it disabled Aero peek. There was a bit of mouse lag and video lag on my second monitor. The higher the video quality, the worse the lag became. I had difficulty uninstalling the software. It took me a while to figure out that I had to go to the taskbar (to the little arrow that points up) and exit the program. Once I did that, Aero peek came back, and the taskbar became transparent again. I give this product 1 star. I am returning it.
