This is what everything that the saler said it was and then some it works Great on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 plus. I bought this item September 7, 2022 and now hear it is December 16,2022 and this product stopped working. So don't waist your money on this item because this item is cheaply pute together and doesn't last very long. Make sure your items have a warranty and buy it because if they don't have a warranty they are cheaply put together.Hear is proof I purchased this product on September 7,2022 and hear it is only December 18,2022 and it doesn't work anymore. That isn't very long for a "Lifetime Warranty".Last purchased Sep 7, 20222Ports-gray
