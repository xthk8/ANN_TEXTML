We bought this adapter to inflate airbed for camping since we wouldn't have any electrical hookup. It worked for the twin to inflate and broke (won't power on at all) when we plugged in our queen air mattress to fill up. We had to sleep on rocks because we had counted on this working and our air beds didn't have a valve to inflate with a battery powered inflator. Zero stars, would NOT recommend.
