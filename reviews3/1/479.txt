I have to wiggle the connection to the phone a few times just to get fast charging. Otherwise it's slow charge which takes hours. I thought it was just happening to one of the cables, so I tried another one and got the same results. It works if you have patience to keep wiggling or keep reconnecting until it fast charges.
