BROKE MY TV!!!I used the supplied screws because the screws that were already on the back of my tv were not long enough to keep the stand on. So I used the supplied screws. And there is only one set of the supplied screws that fit thread wise. Upon screwing them in they screwed right into the screen from behind. And DESTROYED my tv.See attached pic. I did not screw them in to tight either. Normal finger pressure with a plain old screw driver.
