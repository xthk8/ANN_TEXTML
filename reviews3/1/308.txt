The headset broke less than 6 months after buying it with nothing but simple use. I simply put them down and the earmuff broke off of the headset. After talking to amazon, they refer me to Jabra. Many emails back and forth now they are refering me to another website where I can't create an account. Basically there is no warranty if something happens to this headset, I have been referred to three different places still there is no resolution and the warranty they said is effective hasn't replace my headset.
