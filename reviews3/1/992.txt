We've had our HP Envy 5530 for a couple of years now so we've been buying ink for the stupid thing for that amount of time. Sure the product works, but for such a small amount of time. I can print maybe 10-20 pages of color and then it beeps at me and ruins all of my print outs until I choke up another $20 for some colored ink. My husband and I JUST bought a duo pack about a month ago, coinciding with when we started up our own business. Needless to say we're all out of ink again and haven't printed off much more than a handful of legal documents. I'm sick of this printer running out of ink. I'm sick of trying to find these stupid ink cartridges on Amazon that aren't fakes - it's like trying to find a needle in a hay stack. And I said NO MORE - this has to be one of the most unreliable pieces of crap we've ever purchased. Looking into laser printers now - heard big brother has so good stuff....can't wait to leave this printer (with no ink) out by the trash.
