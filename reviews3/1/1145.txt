First of all, even if it worked, it isn't worth the money. You could make a better case yourself out of yarn. But, it DOESN'T WORK. This is a two-piece case and the top will not stay affixed to the AirPods case. Sure, I reckon you could put some form of adhesive to make it stay, but (1) you shouldn't have to do it, and like I said, (2) knit yourself a case from yarn and you'll be better protected.
