We have an XBox Series X at the front of the Living Room and a ceiling mounted projector at the rear of the room. Our existing HDMI cable only allows for 1080p. The projector will display 4k HDR and the XBox Series X, of course, will do the same.We replaced our long old, long cable with this 40 ft one and, to my dismay, we could not get it to work with 4k as advertised. When we told the Series X to convert to 4k graphics, the screen went blank. After the timeout period of 30 seconds, the Series X reverted back to 1080p and the image returned.We have a complex setup with sound system and HDMI wall plates at the wall and on the ceiling so, for troubleshooting, bypassed those and ran the cable from the back of the Series X to the back of the projector directly and we got the same results - a black screen. I moved the Series X to the projector and used a shorter 4k cable we had here at the house and had a picture. Told the Series X, while still connected to the short cable, to convert to 4k graphics and it worked. We had a beautiful image on the wall.I did much troubleshooting with this cable, though, and it did work at 1080p, it just wouldn't run at 4k for anything.I wouldn't recommend the 40ft version for 4k signals and haven't tested shorter lengths to know if those would work or not.
