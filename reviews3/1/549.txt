I got these for my son for Christmas. They worked the first day and then started randomly disconnecting after that. He will turn them on and connect to his Bluetooth. You hear the words “power on” and then can hear through the headphones and a few seconds later you hear “power off” and they are disconnected. No matter how long my son charges them they only work for a few seconds before powering off. We tried everything including rebooting the phone, disconnecting and reconnecting, charging but only get them to connect for a matter of seconds. This is very disappointing because he really wanted these for Christmas. I would not recommend these.
