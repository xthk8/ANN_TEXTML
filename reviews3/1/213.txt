 EDIT 2: this fell off literally 11 days after I got it. Horrible.EDIT: Giving this 4 stars, as there was some user error. You have to completely flatten your pop socket attachment against the phone attachment— the top part has grooves that rotate the plastic thing that locked the pop socket into place. That was not intuitive (when flattened, the pop socket envelopes the plastic lock). Anyways. This works… but it’s not intuitive.I put this on no more than two days ago, and the removable feature has rendered it useless. There’s a built in part of the socket where your pop socket part locks into to the attachment on your phone. This makes the pop socket parts swappable… but the design makes it so that you can’t actually turn the part that’s supposed to lock in place. See my video— as you turn the pop socket, it’s not firmly attached to the part that’s supposed to lock in place. So, you can’t turn it, can’t lock it, and can’t reattach the pop socket. The thing is… I didn’t even try to remove the pop socket! It unlocked on its own.Going to super glue the pop socket back on, but I shouldn’t have to do that. Wish I could just go back and buy a normal pop socket.
