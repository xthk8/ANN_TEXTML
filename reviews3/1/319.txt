Bought this on recommendation of a coworker. I work 100% remote and spend much of the day on customer calls. I was told the range for this model was incredible, something like a couple hundred feet, which I figured was the driver of the high price. However the range is equivalent to an average Bluetooth device when using the BT dongle, so perhaps 30 feet with LOS.The headset is pretty buggy working with MS Teams, microphone is constantly not recognized when going between calls, taking 5-10 minutes to fix disconnecting the dongle, powering off/on, etc. leading to lost productivity when going from call to call. It's worse when switching between different platforms like Zoom or webex. Pretty much every call I have to ask if the other party can hear me, which gets pretty old.Lastly the construction of the headset is very poor, the earpiece is connected to the headband with a thin plastic cylinder that looks designed to break. Headset snapped when putting on after 3 months of use.Overall a complete waste of money, I would never buy another Jabra, overpriced garbage.
