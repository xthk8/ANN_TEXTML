I've been a long time advocate for and user of pop sockets, but the new ones have terrible adhesive. I bought two within a month that popped right off the back of a phone after proper installation while I was simply holding the phone still. Re-applying doesn't work, these are basically only good for a day or two. I've used pop sockets for the last 8 years and all of them would last for multiple years.
