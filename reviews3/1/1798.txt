Iâ€™m not sure if someone had this set before me and maybe returned it but the quality is terrible.after charging my device and using it, I discovered that there is a very noticeable and annoying buzzing sound that comes from the device.I did mix tests and used the different functions of the mix and I still got buzzing.
