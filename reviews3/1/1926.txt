Used this for about 2 months until something happened with the connectors inside the switch box. Took it apart, tested connection etc. Lost all power to the ring light. No warrantee and can’t return it. No idea how it happened, I never moved it from where I originally put it. Had to remove the entire switch box and splice new wires directly to the light. Now I can’t dim, brighten, or change colors. Plus I have to plug it in every time I use it and unplug it when I’m done.
