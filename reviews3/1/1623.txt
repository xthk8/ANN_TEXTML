Fake product, case is black it should be white with a black inside. Really clever and would almost believe it was legitimate. Case feels good and it wirelessly charges. The sound quality seemed to be not up to par and it was really quiet. The box art is pretty dang close to the real ones too. The price is attractive but steer clear and spend the extra on a legit pair. Save yourself the hassle. Fortunately I got through to an Amazon rep and was able to start the refunding process.
