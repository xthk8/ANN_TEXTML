What’s the point of a phone charger that can charge an iPhone 12? Neither my phone or my partners can charge from these poor quality cables. At a perfect angle and zero movement they can in fact work, but 90% of the time it won’t charge. Very fickle. And the plastic sheath around the lighting port is loose and slides off as you try to plug in your phone.Spend 2x the price and get ones that work. Avoid these.
