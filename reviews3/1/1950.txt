I purchased the least expensive surge protector from a known brand. Don’t make my mistake. Spend more money and get something decent.CONS:1. My main complaint is that the outlets are all loose. Anything plugged into them will randomly just fall out! (then I have to move the couch and squish back there to plug it back in).2. The cord is also incredibly stiff3. You really can’t fit more than three plugs at a time since the outlets are so close together.PROS:NONE - It was a complete waste of money. I couldn’t even return it since Amazon has been so horrible about returns lately.
