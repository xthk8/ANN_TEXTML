NOW, I read all the other reviews citing this problem. Who'd have bothered for a $7 product to read reviews? But now I have to go through the return cycle which is a huge nuisance as well as added wait time. Buyer beware. I could skip it (I usually do for products under $20) but I'm so annoyed I want to make a point. Why does Amazon not only sell but feature such a piece of garbage in their Basics collection?!? Get with it Amazon, make sure your featured products actually WORK before you offer them!! You undermine the credibility of your entire Basics line when you sell unreliable garbage in it.
