I’m very disappointed. They sent me a used pair. Device history confirmed that it was paired to someone else’s phone apart from factory testing. Which means this was on someone else’s head. Gross. Packaging was also not new, to further confirm.Sound quality was worse than my Q30’s, which are falling apart. That’s why I ordered these. Guess, I’ll have to keep using those until I can find a replacement brand. Anker really dropped the ball on this. I won’t be buying any more over-ear headphones from them, after this.I was in disbelief at the lacking sound quality of these. They’re like headphones you buy out of a big box bargain bin or something. I played with the EQ settings in the app, bass boost, made a few custom EQ’s, tried out all the noise cancelling settings.No matter what I did, the quality just wasn’t great, whether playing music through my PC or phone. I just can’t believe they’d put out a product that is this much worse than the previous one and for nearly double the cost. Just appalling.If I were you, I’d look elsewhere for some quality headphones.
