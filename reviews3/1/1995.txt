This car charger was purchased in February and it was amazing. It provided fast charging as advertised on my iPhone and Samsung Galaxy. I can verify with my Galaxy S20 because it will tell me when it is fast charging and when charging is abnormally slow.The fast charging port (orange) barely emits enough electricity to charge my phone. My Galaxy S20 will alert me that the charging speeds are slow and to check the connection. It estimates 4 hours of charge time from 1%.The regular charge port (black) still charges normally and will charge my Galaxy S20 from 2% in about 2 hours. I will contact the manufacturer for an exchange. Hopefully they have good customer service to make up for the bad product. I will update this if that happens.
