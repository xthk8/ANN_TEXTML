I bought this so I had a way to use a bottle warmer for my son. Your vehicle must be turned on (waste of gas if pulled over.) The light turned blue for 2 seconds then it turned off and started flashing red, which is a warning sign. I didn’t even have it on for a full 2 seconds and the box, cord and car plug in are all burning up. It was just a simple 3.5 hour drive. I kept the item in a cool space so it didn’t get overheated. Yet when it started flashing red, the car plug part sparked and almost caught on fire. Do not buy.
