I don’t think I’ve ever given anything a bad review on Amazon… but I had to with this thing!I had only two items plugged into this surge protector, both at the furthest plugs away from the power switch (numbers 5 and 6.) Those worked fine for several months. Both items were fairly low wattage items (a small speaker and a small fish tank pump.) When I added a third item (a small aeration pump for a fish tank) that item worked for a few minutes, then failed. It was broken (didn’t work on any outlets after initially functioning.) I thought it was a failure of that particular device (defective), so I got a replacement. Plugged in the new item, and same result… worked, then stopped working. I figured wow, what a crappy brand of pump—2 different units failed after working for only a few minutes…Well, later, I stupidly plugged in some more expensive stereo equipment into the same slot as the 2 small pumps that blew/failed… and those items are now fried/broken as well. It seems the outlets furthest away from the power switch on this surge protector worked ok, but anything upstream of those fried at least 3 different devices. I’m out a couple hundred bucks from damaged equipment now—and the only thing in common is this power strip/surge protector.Like other reviewers have mentioned, this seems like a knock off… it feels very cheap and not what I expected from a GE product.I think I got lucky though that it only damaged some items Vs. catching fire and burning my house down. I 100% believe the other reviewers who describe melting/burning/fires when using this product.Save yourself time, money and grief and a potentially dangerous situation and buy a different, higher quality power strip/surge protector.
