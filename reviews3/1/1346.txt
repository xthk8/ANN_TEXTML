So I waited a few months to write this to give it the benefit of the doubt and make sure it wasn’t user error, this is by far the most disappointing product I’ve ever gotten on amazon. I have an iPhone XR with a pretty average sized clear case on it (which most definitely does not weigh 15 pounds) This cannot support my phone whatsoever, (as the 15 pound maximum promised) when I make the slowest and slightest turn or even as small of a movement as switching lanes my phone flops over and cannot stay upright, I’ve had three separate people help with tightening and ensuring it’s held correctly but it truly is just the bad support of a cheaply made product. The suction was a nightmare, I’ve cleaned and attempted to stick it on multiple times and it did not work, I tried every way I could think of and even followed their instructions perfectly, frustrated I ended up super gluing it just for it to stay mounted. The clips for the vents that were provided are even worse than the mounts and continued to slip off of and could not hold my phone upright whatsoever. I really try to not write bad reviews, if I’m disappointed I just throw the product away and ignore it, but this truly is so awful and such a waste of money I felt the need to review, there are better products out there. Skip this one. (I can post pictures and videos if requested)
