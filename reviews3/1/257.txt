I bought these and one wasn’t even in the package so there was only 2, but they were cheap so I didn’t care at first. For the first night it worked great, my phone charged fast and the cord is super long, the second night I tried plugging it in and nothing happened. I checked the power outlet, the box it was plugged into and the only thing that didn’t work was the cord. Waste of money, don’t buy!!
