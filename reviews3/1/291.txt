Picks up speaking and singing voice well. Cuts out if Rs are rolled, if trilling is made, and cannot pick up vocals that approximate howling. Further, snapping fingers does not register at all, nor does clicking tongue or anything other than sounds produced by vocal cords. It is really surreal.So, good if you are only speaking and never inflecting, but bad for TTRPGs when sound effects are sometimes necessary, also bad for non-English speakers who trill, click, or roll Rs.The physical construction seems decent and it looks nice. I was really excited after trying it out, as the sound quality for speaking is great, but it's dead silence for anything but speaking.
