I have a pair of the Samsung Buds 2 Pro. It works fine but the seal is not the best. So out of curiosity I wanted to try the Linkbuds S. The first pair I received is defective in that the left bud will disconnect for no reason from time to time, and the right bud battery level always goes down much faster than the left one. I had to return it and order another one. The second one obviously is not new, there are signs of usage on both the packaging and the earbuds. The sound is only mono not stereo. Don't know why. I am sure it's not my phone since my Buds 2 Pro plays the stereo sound just fine. I am very disappointed. Had to return it again now and I am not going to waste time on a third unit. To be fair the Linkbuds S creates a better seal than the Buds 2 Pro, that's why I gave it one star.
