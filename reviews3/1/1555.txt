So, I’ve had TWO different sets of AirPods Pro (first pair I bought, second I received as a Christmas gift). Both at first always passed the “Fit Test”. But after a couple months with each pair, the Fit Test starts to constantly fail, even with the largest tips. And it does affect the ANR.So I was looking for a solution and found these foam tips. So I decided to give them a try. Firstly, I accidentally ordered a box of all smalls thinking it had the three sizes like what came with the AirPods Pro. So none of those worked. I’m returning those and decided then to just buy a box of the large ones. Not once have I been able to get both to seal. Only the right one ever seals, but then after a few minutes the seal wears off of that one as well (I thought they were supposed to expand over time?)I’m starting to thing that the AirPods Pro may just be a fundamentally flawed product especially considering even medium worked for me in the beginning and now none of them work including large (and with two different sets of AirPods Pro as I said). Maybe an X-Large tip might work but considering the seal seems to keep getting worse I’m not even sure about that.I cannot recommend this product.
