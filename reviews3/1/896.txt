After using the 64GB version for a 4-5 months in a VIOFO dash cam I noticed frequent gaps in the recordings while driving. Switching to a new 128GB version of the Samsung PRO Endurance seems to solve the issue, so the performance of the 64GB card must be the problem.I tried to reach Samsung support for warranty replacement, but gave up after I was bounced through several support contacts and wasted a morning trying to reach SD card support. And you cannot even register the SD card on SAMSUNG web site because the serial number on the card does not have 15 digits.
