Got this because it seemed like a great option for plugging in all my stuff, but the USB ports aren't properly mounted. Either they got broken during delivery or were never moved to begin with.I'm not willing to plug this in because I don't know what else might be wrong inside. I'm returning this, but at this time I'm unsure if I'm returning for a replacement or if I'm going to get a different product.
