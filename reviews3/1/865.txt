The best thing I can say about these earbuds is that both buds worked and pairing them was relatively easy.Outside of that, my experience with these were bad. The sound level was super low. I had to turn the volume up all the way but they still sounded like they were at 50%. Bass and treble were nonexistent. Most music sounded muddy.The buds themselves were very uncomfortable to wear. None of the extra silicone coverings gave me a good fit. Plus the way they had to be positioned in the ear was awkward. They also had a tendency to fall out of the ears.I'm pretty bummed that these didn't end up working out for me. The low "sale" price isn't even what these are worth.
