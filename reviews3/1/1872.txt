I bought this after seeing great views and also because I have the Sony WF-C500 that is $100 less than the LinkBuds S thinking it will be just as good but with noise-cancellation added with I need. But the S is an inferior product. The battery life is less and most annoying is you can not use the Left bud while charging the Right bud. You have to use the Right bud in order for the Left bud to work. This means I can't extend the battery life of use by alternating the 2 and never run out of battery which is what I had with the WF-C500. I've never once ran out of battery with those after using for 6 months but for the LinkBuds S, it ran out of battery 2 weeks into using it because I could not alternate using the buds so that one is charging up while I'm using the order and therefore never ever run out of battery.Connecting to the Samsung phone is also very slow compared with the C500 and C500 audibly tells you how much battery you have left when you 1st put in your ear. S doesn't have that and just a soft chime to indicates that is connected but C500 also confirms that is it connected audibly. And much more irritating is after having the S buds out of your ear for about 15mins and you want to pick up again where you left off with a video or listening, you can not connect the S to the phone again, you have to physically place the buds back into the case and pull them out again to reconnect to the phone. This is absolutely stupid.I think if I didn't use the C500 before, may be would give this a 4 starts, but to go from C500 to this that is $100 more expensive and it is suppose to be technologically superior but falls so far short.
