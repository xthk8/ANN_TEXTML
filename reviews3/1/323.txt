I bought it because I wanted a wireless headset mainly for meetings - but also for watching videos and music. Overall - for voice - it has a decent sound - does the job and works well. The mic does a decent job - but it really has to be right up on your mouth to work well. Music/video was alright - it wasn't anything special. Also - the battery progressively got worse and worse at holding a charge.... especially when on standby.However, after owning for just almost 1.5 years - the ratcheted adjustment for head depth broke on one side.... causing it to not have the natural "stops" that prevent it from going up or down... but also this side panel pops off half way when I try to adjust it. I can pop it back in place - but the problem repeats itself.If this was a $50 pair of headphones - I wouldn't feel so bad... However, I spent $200 on this piece of gear - and I really expected it to be more durable. It is not worth $200 for a year and a half of use (and actually only really limited to a few hours a day - and it was well taken care of.So it was decent while it was not broken - but too expensive to break beyond repair within about 4 months of getting outside of the one year warranty. Jabra either needs to make their expensive gear far more durable - or they need to extend the warranty so people don't feel taken advantage of.At this point - I wouldn't buy another Jabra device... and I can be pretty forgiving on this stuff. It just cost too much to have to purchase another one a bit over a year after purchasing it. There are options at 1/2 the price that are minimally as durable.
