Bought a 57 and 61 tri color for two different printers. Both arrived in the same pack but they did not combine shipping. Both were not in box as pictured in the ad. They arrived in a bubble wrap package in the foil packs. I figured this was to save on shipping and that did not bother me. It did bother me that there was a note saying "as stated in the ad these may not be in original box". I went back and checked the ads and found no such reference. When I installed the 57 it never worked. Foil pack had a NOV06 date on it. When I installed the 61 color the alignment sheet printed and it looked like that one was okay. I didn't look at the foil pack on it before I discarded it because I wasn't expecting these problems. Just tried printing a photo with the 61 last night and got an incompatible ink message and the printer will not work with it at all. The merchant (PCNPRINT) provided quick refunds but I still had to go buy ink local to do my printing. I basically wasted a week and a half and watched my money float back and forth from them then back to me.
