I ordered this product because it had great reviews and came recommended in a podcasting blog. I received it and was excited to get started on my project and found it didn’t work. My computer didn’t even register that it was plugged into my USB. I returned it and waited another week, the second one arrived and again I was excited to start my project. The usb this time at least worked but it said it could not recognize the device and there was most likely an issue with it. I called Samson for a second time (I called with the first microphone as well) and he sent me and email of how to troubleshoot my USB drives not working which again wasn’t the case because all my other devices work just fine. When he said it would have to be replaced and that would probably be a two week turn around I decided to cut my losses and buy a different microphone. Amazon customer service is the best, but Samson is awful, awful products awful customer service I’d never buy from them again
