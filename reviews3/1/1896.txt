To stop it moving you need to tighten it securely but eventually the plastic base cracks and the product needs to be thrown out. If you don't tighten it sufficiently then you can't move the arm around without it coming off. They should have made the clamp out of stronger material as it is the product will not last long and you will need to throw it out. Don't buy this product.
