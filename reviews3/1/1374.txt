I ordered two of these for my two office printers which were getting low. I entered my printer model number in the "check to see if this fits" link and the results said it fit. It does not. Sadly, the toner in the old cartridges didn't actually run out until today and so I missed the return window by 20 days. I'm stuck with two full cartridges that I can't return and that cost me more than $244 total and I'm stuck with it. What a waste of money!
