This case is horrible for the Apple ultra watch. They have designed the side of the case so bulky over the side button that every single time I move my wrist. It either turns the watch on or opens up the multiple window menu or wants to power down the watch. I literally spend every two minutes turning off my watch because of my wrist hitting this large Side of the watch case thatâ€™s way too bulky and causes this problem.
