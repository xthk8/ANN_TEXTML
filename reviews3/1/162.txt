Did not work with my 58" samsung model UN58TU7000FXZA. The back is 400x300mm VESA standard, but the holes are too far from the bottom of the TV. Some other 'universal' stands that I looked at mentioned the maximum distance between the bottom of the TV frame and the bottom of the mount slots. This one did not, so I assumed it was compatible with most any distance, but that was not the case. I didn't write down the numbers but I think it was about 13" from the bottom most VESA holes to the TV frame's bottom, which was much longer than this mount could fit on. Please add this info to the product description
