Pros:Good sound, good build quality, great slick design. But you won't want to use any of it.CONS:I have the original Jaybird Vista and it does not have ANY of issues.This has the worst firmware issues of anything I have used EVER (and this is after some major updates. It is still horrible).- Frequent issue with audio/video desync when first connected.- Very often the phone will only connect to one heaphone, and you have to spend a while figure out why your phone doesn't simply recognize the other side. (Again this never happens with the original Vista).- Often when you take them out of the charging case, they simply won't connect and force connect by button press or from the phone don't work either.- It WILL require a lot of hard resets. I can't tell you how many times before my workout I have to spend 5-10 mins trouble shooting because one of the headphones is glitching like crazy, or straight up stuck playing a stutter sound, or simply would not connect one side. A hard reset solves it, but it is incredibly annoying because you can never rely on it to simply just work.- You CANNOT turn off the auto pause feature (there is an option in the setting, but it doesn't actually do anything and multiple firmware updates later it still doesn't do anything). That means EVERYTIME you remove one of your headphones, your media will pause, and you can't properly resume it if you still hold the headphone. Actually if the headphone is still in your hand, the media doesn't even reliably stay paused either, and instead just randomly stops and plays.Other "feature creeping" leading to really awful issues:- Since the "SurroundSense" tech is literlly just mics facing outwards in your headphones (what a ridiculously dumb way to solve this issue), even if you hold the headphone slightly wrong in this mode in palm, your headphones will start shrieking with feedback, very likely damaging the hardware.- The tapping gesture could not be more unreliable and often have sync issue between the 2 ear buds.Overall, DO NOT buy this unless if you are down to waste a lot of time trouble shooting (especially if you are tech savvy, then you will be even more irritated by the dumb designs).
