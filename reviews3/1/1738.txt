The color is nice, but the scant few rolls of tape contained in the cartridge is pretty pitiful. I've used TZ Brother cartridges for 8 years and have never seen even a free sample tape with so little tape. There is about 5 ft. of tape compared to about 26 ft. for the standard 1/2" cassette. Read the fine print. They do disclose that fact, but since Brother tapes have been reasonably standard in the past, I didn't look at the product specifications when I purchased the pink berry color.Despite the length, I loved the color and immediately proceeded to make a label - but nothing came out. I pulled the cassette out of the printer and there was a big rat's nest of pink tape and white backing. There was nothing that could be rescued or re-fed through the slot so as to salvage the roll. I returned it. No wonder "Pretty in Pink" is a horror movie!
