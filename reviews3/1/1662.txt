I have the MusiCozy headphone band. Looks exactly the same as the pictures. I like the band itself. My problem is that, unlike what their brochure says, there is absolutely no way to remove the speakers from the headband in order to wash it. They are sawn in. Either they lied on their brochure, or I have a fake MusiCozy. I am not an idiot. It's not a comicated device. The center piece with the buttons on it can be taken out and I can disconnect the cables to the speakers, but the cables are sawn into the band. There are no other openings anywhere on the band to pull speakers out. I have watched online videos on similar bands showing how to take the speakers out and on this band you can't. After few uses at the gym, it is sweaty and stinky....and since you can't remove speakers from it to wash it, it becomes useless and you have to throw it away. Money wasted. Very disappointed. Don't know if there are different MusiCozy models out there, but on my model you cannot remove the speakers this can't wash it. Will not be buying these anymore. I have seen this exact headband on here on Amazon under many different brand names, MusiCozy being one of them. Dont know if they are all the same, but avoid MusiCozy if you can.
