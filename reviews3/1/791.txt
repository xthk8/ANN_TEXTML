Why is it that we have to expect/accept this level of quality? Why is it the nom that products like this are so hard to avoid on Amazon? How did these get a decent rating--I arranged my results after filtering for four (4) + stars to list best to worst. These were near the top, had a convincing number of reviews, & the number--three (3), not anything weird--and this was the best I could do. Thanks, Amazon & whatever-your-name-is seller.I ordered 3 of these lightning to USB cables on June 27. One (1) of them still works. I work in tech, I know how to handle power & data cables, there is no reasonable defense for 2/3 of your product failing like it has done.I would like a refund, or, at the absolute least: two (2) cables to replace the one (1) that died within one (1) week of receiving + the other, which died at least two (2) weeks ago.
