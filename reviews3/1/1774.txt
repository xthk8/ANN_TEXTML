DO NOT BUY this product this product completely ruined my S21 ultra. I was planning to use this product to use on my phone to play through my speakers an when i went to put they type C cord in my phone it gave a Moisture detected Notification and ever since i put that cord in I cannot charge my phone with the type C cord now I have to spend $200 on a new phone And the only way to charge the phone is to use a cordless charger to charge it this is buy far they worst product i bought from this company.
