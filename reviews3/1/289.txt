For how intrusive this mic is, you'd think it would have an awesome sound quality. This is very much not the case - besides the fact that my webcam mic is actually as clear as this one, it also cuts out extremely bad... I am constantly blipping in and out and my viewers have no idea what I'm trying to say. Plus, it really kills the vibe in the stream when there are technical difficulties (which I constantly have with this mic).Overall just not satisfied. If I could return it, I would. I really just wanted something at least semi-professional sounding and this mic does not achieve that goal. Like I said, the audio quality is not an improvement from what come standard with my webcam.Also, tho the mic is adjustable it doesn't really stay in the place it's adjusted too... moves around a lot. Also like I said, it's very IN YOUR FACE..Would not recommend! Spend a little more and I think you can get better quality (more clear and consistent) audio.I was going to give this 2 stars but then I stopped and thought about it... why would I? there isn't really anything I like about it. Changed it to 1.
