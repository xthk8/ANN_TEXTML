The review is negative only because the arm broke. While I had it, it worked exactly as advertised. The arm was stiff like it was supposed to be. The phone clamp worked great. The base clamp was surprisingly much more sturdy than I expected from an all plastic clamp.The way the product broke was from the metal core work hardening and breaking from too much adjustment in the same place. This was placed on the headboard above my bed and was adjusted probably twice a day, sometimes more. I have two of these, so I believe I received a faulty unit with poor quality core material as the other unit, which ive had just as long, has not broken.For potential purchasers: Treat this thing like a paper clip. You can bend it, but don't make the adjustments hard and fast or make the bends with small radii. Also, eventually it WILL fail simply because the metal core will work harden as it's adjusted and break. How you adjust it will make a huge difference in its longevity. If the other one fails the same way ill make sure to amend this review to reflect a one off quality issue vs a bad product.
