I purchased this cartridge in October of 2020 as a back up. Today, Sept. 4th 2021, I opened it and was shocked and horrified to find that after I opened the brand new box, and the blue and white plastic package, the tape covering the ink was already pulled off. I put the cartridge into my printer and printed a test page and found it was empty! There was very light color of only blue and some yellow! I tried printing another sheet in color and it also had only very light yellow. Then a box popped up on my computer saying I had inserted a used cartridge! HOW DID THIS HAPPEN????
