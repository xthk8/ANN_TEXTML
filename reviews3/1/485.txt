When I purchased this the description stated that it does not make your phone hot. It's quite the opposite from what was stated. My phone runs very HOT ðŸ”¥ while charging. Both the screen and the back of the phone. It's quite scary! I'm charging my phone and have to watch it to make sure that it doesn't explode or burn something up. At this rate I will need a new phone because the insides will have charred. Also I know that it's these charging cables. The spare charging cable bought elsewhere that i use at work does not make my phone hot at all. Guess that I'll take this "L" and toss these before they burn something up or down.
