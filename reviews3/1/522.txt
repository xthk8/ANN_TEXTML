The Design for these headphones is great as they are confortable that is where it ends. These head phones lack in every other aspect they don't have great battery life, the sound quality is terrible. Where is the bass? Even when you increase the sound level it distorts terribly. When I connect them to my PS5 controller or any wired set up all I hear is static have wored pop aDo yourself the favor and move on to the next set of headphones. These headphones also rattle like something is loose this seems Like a major quality control issue....if a rep from MOVSSOU would like contact me about this I would like to give suggestions to help the product.
