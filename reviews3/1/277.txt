Build quality: checkBassy intimate voice when whispering closeup: check (I don't do Onlyfans, though)Easy to install: checkRecording podcasts or commentary while speaking normally... Mmm, how do I put it? It clips, and clips horribly, and there's nothing you can do. Expander, compressor, thresholds, effects, lowering sensitivity in your software... I doesn't work.I lowered the gain to +5 (from 100 that is recommended by the manufacturer), I can barely hear my own voice, but I do hear that it CLIPS ON VOWELS!I put the pop filter on, the dead cat or however it's called nowadays, I leaned away 5, 10, 20, 30 inches and IT STILL CLIPS.So much pain and suffering just because I couldn't afford a more expensive option, and not a single reviewer or YouTuber mentioned this problem.
