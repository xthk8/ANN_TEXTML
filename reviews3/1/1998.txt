I don’t know why this happened to me since it had so many good reviews, but after I connected my usb charger to it and connected it to my phone (iPhone 13 pro max), smoke started coming out of my phone!! Thank God it doesn’t appear to have caused any damage, but it’s probably because I caught it as soon as it started. I don’t recommend it.
