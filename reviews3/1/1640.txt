I purchased this microphone based on all the positive reviews. When I received it, the package had obviously been opened and I was sent someone else's return minus all of the extras that it's supposed to come with (no tripod, no USB cable, etc.). I returned it (gotta love Prime!) and received another one that included everything, although it appeared as though it may have been opened as well. I used it for several months and it was great - great sound quality, super-easy to set up and use, etc. However, 5 months later, overnight, it suddenly stopped working. I plug it in, it picks up my voice, then immediately starts this weird, electronic humming. Any and all sounds that come through the microphone are just different versions of this electronic noise. It's like something inside the microphone has come loose and I'm pretty sure it was probably refurbished or returned at the least. I'm so sick of buying electronic stuff on Amazon that's either returned, fake or refurbished and yet I pay full price! Normally, these things fail quickly enough to get a full refund. This one lasted too long, so now I have junk. I bought another one from Best Buy (same, exact price) this time. I'm so disappointed in Amazon's quality control. Based on other reviews, it's obvious other people have also gotten returned or refurbished merchandise and have had similar issues. I have slowly started to move away from purchasing this kind of stuff from Amazon and this is exactly the reason why. I should have known better.
