I love Anker products and was wishing for the best for these headphones. On the positive side, the sound is really pretty solid, especially with the fine tuning ability of the Soundcore App, and the noise cancellation is acceptable.But...the headphones are unusually gigantic. They stick out so far from your head to the point that they look somewhat silly, are very large on top so they don't clamp down well and, well, those enormous ear cups!I have a normal sized male head and, even with the Q45's on the tightest setting, they are loose on the top of my head. Sitting perfectly still they are fine, but the second you walk around or move with them on, they feel pretty loose.But the biggest issue is that the ear cups are just enormous (look at the pic to get a sense of their enormity and how much of your ear, and head, they envelop). The ear cups stick far out and frankly look silly, the headphones don't grip down on my ears so outside sounds leak in despite the ANC, and the materials are definitely not high end.Sadly, I'm going to return these. If it was just about the audio quality and the noise cancellation I would have definitely kept them, especially at this price. But short of being a giant, these headphones are just way too large in every direction to be keepers.
