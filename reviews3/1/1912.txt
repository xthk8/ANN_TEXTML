Needed a longer cable to link my TV to my receiver for surround sound, worked initially but then stopped transmitting sound across ARC connection. Tried a known shorter cable as a temp solution, it works as intended. Returned this 20ft cable to Amazon as defective, got a second one, same issue. Not sure why it won't transmit sound properly but at this point it's a cable issue since it's happened twice in a row with the same cable from the same manufacturer.
