None of the cartridges from HP will no longer work on my HP Envoy 4500 printer; you will get the message "this cartridge is not compatible with this printer". The rep from Office Depot told me this is HP's way of forcing us to buy new printers, so I bought a new one. The start-up cartridge in the box (which I understand is of limited use, just enough to get you started) wouldn't work even on the new printer.. I had to buy new separate cartridges, and they worked. I believe this is a HP consumer rip-off, and unfortunately, there's nothing you can do about it except never buy another HP printer.To make matters worse, Office Depot wouldn't give me any allowance for the non-usable cartridges, even though they were an inducement to my buying the new printer. They even tested the defective cartridges on their floor model, and got the same results.Bottom line: avoid HP printers and cartridges, and test Office Depot products before you leave the store.
