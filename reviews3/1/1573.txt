I've literally purchased dozens of these for various offices over the years. I don't know what polycom did when they bought these but the microphone quality went from "best I've ever heard" to "are you on a speaker phone talking from 20 feet away?" I figured I got a dud, my next purchase was a month or two later of 5 more and they all sound that way. Very disappointing.
