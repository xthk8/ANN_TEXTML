Possible this cable is just poor due to the length of 20' and maybe will work better with shorter runs. I have this running from a home theater PC to my Surround Processor. This is the second cable with the same issue. I also have the PC set for 1080p, so bandwidth should not be an issue. This is a perfect example of, you get what you pay for. How do I know.I purchased another cable, a more expensive one and made the same run, using the same HDMI ports and its flawless.....
