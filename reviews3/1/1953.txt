I purchased this surge protector less than a year ago and it has already failed, taking an expensive bed heating unit with it. A few weeks ago we had a storm and a tree branch fell on a nearby power line, causing a spike in voltage.I filed a claim with Jasco (the company which *actually* makes this product, not GE) and it was denied.> "This device is not a lightning arrestor, so it will not afford protection when lightning strikes nearby power line, the house, service entrance or antenna. The Warranty is void if a power disturbance damages your equipment through the phone or network lines."> “Do not use this product in any way with a generator, heater, sump pump, water-relateddevice, life support device, medical device, car, motorcycle, or golf cart battery charger.
