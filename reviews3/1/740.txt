I had this for one day. I plugged in ONE device to it (a 19" tv) and after an hour the tv started acting funny. I thought maybe it the was the Roku stick, so I unplugged the stick but the TV still acted weird. So I figured I'd unplug the tv as well, but the charger was super hot. Like "had to use a towel to unplug it from the power strip" hot. Absolutely terrible product and most likely a fire hazard.DO NOT BUY.
