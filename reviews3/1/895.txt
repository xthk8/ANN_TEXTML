I plugged this into my MacBook and checked the storage header. It came up as Norelsys Bios. I thou this was a little strange because all my Samsung sd card come up Samsung and some storage data info. I caught this because i plugged into my windows computer and it rebooted to change my bios. Luckily I hit the escape key to bypass the bios spyware and takeover of my computer by china. Also this card functioned erratically in my MacBook as it was trying to read the bios spyware. Do not buy these under any circumstances!!! They are not legitimate Samsung.
