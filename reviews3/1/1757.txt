Black printing tape was misfed upon opening package. Had to YouTube how to fix it as the brother.com site was no help. No solution on Amazon either. YouTube had several videos showing how to open the cartridge, pull the black tape spool out, tape the broken area of tape, re-thread the tape and close the cartridge casing making sure all the pins line up. I was so irritated after about an hour of research and trying to fix it, I gave up and shoved it across the table. The open cartridge slid off the table and spilled all 3 tape spools onto the floor, spools rolling and unwinding in every direction. I understand that this a common problem with this particular kind of tape.
