This product is a joke and effectively a scam. The magnet is extremely low strength. It BARELY holds on in the portrait orientation, and if you turn the phone 90 degrees and give it even the slightest bump (like you would experience on the road when driving), the phone falls off immediately.Compare the magnet strength to the Pop Socket magsafe attachment, which is smaller yet holds the phone without falling off in any orientation. So clearly they could have used stronger magnets but didn't. Meanwhile, this product is 4x the cost.Scam and a rip-off
