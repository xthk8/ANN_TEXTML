By the time the event took place and I got it processed and it was returned, the return window is closed. I turned in 3 of the 6 cameras that came with the order and two of them have a notice from Fuji that the film was compromised by light exposure prior to us taking the photos. The third one also had poor photo quality but no such notice. Since these are used for precious moments it is TRAGIC that you find out later that the photos are no good, and insult to injury is that due to the timing of all this this vendor still got profit from selling it to me. Walgreens did refund me the processing cost which is not their fault to bear that.
