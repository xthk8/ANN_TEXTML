Ordered several of these in 2020. They were supposed to be black print on white tape with acid-free adhesive. The first ones used were, but the last two were not white, they were clear and they didn't have ANY adhesive. I called Brother and was told they couldn't (or wouldn't) replace them because they were past the 90-day warranty. So ... it's my fault that I ordered enough to last almost a year without having to constantly reorder. And I guess it is also my fault that I didn't bother to open everyone of the packages to be sure that what was on the inside was the same thing as the packaging said on the outside.In fact, the only thing they said I could do would be to order some more to replace them (at my cost) or contact Amazon directly since that is who we ordered them through. It's NOT Amazon's fault that they put the wrong cartridges into the wrong packaging!!!I have always been a fan of Brother labelers and labels, but this was ridiculous. Since it is the company's labeler I will be forced to continue ordering these P-Touch tape cartridges, but you can be sure that I will only order one at time so I can be covered by their 90-day warranty.Sincerely sincere,Joyce L., Bookkeeper for a great company
