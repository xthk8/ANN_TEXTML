Stopped working on 2nd use. Has no on/off feature. I actually get worse or no sound from soccer games with this device. It worked for one session and I had to delete some sound as it claims to be directional - but picked up everything around the mic, including behind, my voice, I only wanted the soccer game sound. Anyway, not getting another of these. Did not work as claimed and failed on 2nd use. I confirmed this on the 3rd try. Junk. Avoid.
