Not a very great adapter, picture is pixelated, off color, and random blue lines. I tested it on 2 monitors and 2 computers so it’s definitively the cord. It’s also under 10$ so I didn’t expect much, but would definitely not buy again.Would like to edit this after trying to use it for a month. So far it has been nothing but a hassle. The image on my external monitor cuts in and out at least once a minute, the colors have become so distorted and yellowed that you can not tell which is which, there are horizontal bars going through the entire display, and the display images are also very washed out. I would definitely never order this product. Generally the Amazon Basics are fairly decent midlevel products for a lower price point. This time was not the case, I would never buy this again. This has been the worst Amazon Basic product I have ever bought, and I really expected a lot better from Amazon. Just spend the extra money and get an actual working adapter. -1 / 5
