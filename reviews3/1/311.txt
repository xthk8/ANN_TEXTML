UPDATE: As soon as I submitted the review, my dang headset broke AGAIN at the exact same spot as the first one. DON’T BUY THIS! I’m so upset I spent this money on terrible manufacturing and now I'm stuck with it. I had to duct tape the ear peace in place.Old review: I wanted to leave a review because I felt like the only reason I purchased this headset was because of all the great reviews. I work from home and originally got mine about a year ago. The headset snapped within the first month of use, and I had to get a warranty replacement. First of all, it’s really hard to adjust the headband to your head - I don’t have a big head so even adjusting the length, there are huge gaps at the side of my head. The headphone also tends to slide off your head if you bend over to pick up something and headset falls right off. Now I’m dealing with a glitchy issue where the hands free sound goes off for a whole minute, as if I’ve unplugged the charge cord. Nothing but problems with this, but I’m stuck with it because lord knows I can’t throw down hundreds of dollars on these things.
