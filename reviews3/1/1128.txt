The part of the cover that goes over the lid will not stay on. I usually wear this on my belt and constantly have to put the cover back on the lid. Somehow dust collects in between the lid and the case. Almost every time I open the top, the cover comes off. The bottom stays on fine.The color is nice, and the feel is very soft. I thought I’d like it based on the other reviews. However, I have already bought a replacement. I do regret buying this one. I’ve had it for two months. Have tried everything I could for the last month to make it stick. It’s an inexpensive product, so at least I’m not out that much money.
