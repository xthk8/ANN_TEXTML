I replaced my stock EarPod tips with these and found the extremely comfortable and secure; however, soon after, I started having problems with one of the EarPods getting charged. It took the Apple Store tech one look at the tips to identify these tips as the problem. Apparently the memory foam tips are slightly larger than the stock versions, which *can* disrupt the charging connection. I wasn’t entirely clear on this point, but it may be a Pro-specific issue as opposed to all EarPods. This is unfortunate as they are quite comfortable. But I haven’t had any charging issues since reverting go stock-style tips.
