Once I took it out of the box, I was surprised that every review written about it was not negative. While the construction looks sturdy and robust, once a person actually tries to use it, the device presents numerous problems. On the positive side, the table grip did seem sturdy and effective. Thatâ€™s about the only positive. The actual phone holder seemed fairly weak. The slightest movement of any kind would set the phone bouncing around to a point where viewing the camera would make a person dizzy. The worst part was the actual neck itself. It was like trying to unwind a water hose filled with frozen molasses. You would be better off just buying a tripod, as the gooseneck component is pretty much irrelevant with this device.
