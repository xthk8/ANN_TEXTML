looked, great and sounded great for an hour. then died on my TWELVE HOUR FLIGHT! so had to use crappy airline earbuds. nothing i tried would ever get them to turn back on or charge or work. yes i tried charging them when in the hotel. several times over several days. Nothing. besides obvious bad build and materials quality. Total rip off. Junk. bad design on switches as well. that could be why they failed. need a dedicated on off real switch. Not that joke on the side.
