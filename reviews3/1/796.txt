Considering the size and price the sound quality, noise cancellation, battery life, recharge time, and comfort are all good, however this product is almost useless. At first I gave those a 2/5 stars review, but since then I used them some more and I came to the conclusion I was too nice in my review.Just using those earbuds is a pain. I tried using them with 2 devices (a Mac laptop and an Android phone) just to make sure my issues are not the fault of the source device, and got the same results.First of all, when first connecting there is about a 50-50 change that only one side will work, disconnecting and reconnecting usually fixes this. After they are connected and already playing, occasionally one side will just stop working for about two or three seconds. Both sides do this occasionally, and sometimes they both do it at the same time so you hear nothing.They are useless for anything that is two-way like phone calls. The other side cannot hear you and you have to use the microphone on your phone/laptop.The touch on the earbuds is totally inconsistent. The slightest movement or touch triggers them, so any time you want to slightly adjust one of the earbuds it stops playing or drops the call. However when you intentionally want to trigger them it takes 2-3 tries to touch them in just the right way for them to register it. This means a lot of time is spent fussing with them.Those issues make the earbuds useless for calls or anything that is realtime. They can only be used for listening to music or watching videos, and even for those uses they are annoying.
