ill just say one thing , the mic on my apple MacBook is far better than this Mic,I should clarify , I didn't expect it to be great for the price I payed , I have a good mic already , but am away from home and thought this would be at least slightly better than a lap top mic as a quick fix, but its actually worse , it distorts even at low volume, absolutely shocking piece of gear....absolute waste of time, absolute shambles of a Mic
