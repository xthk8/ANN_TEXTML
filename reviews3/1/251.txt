Don't buy these, they do not work. You will get lucky if one works and if it does it will stop working very quickly. I though maybe the ones I purchased were defected but then they sent me another set and same thing. For days we were thinking it was the charging brick but NOPE. Use a genuine apple cable it works perfectly. Us this and your battery wont charge quick or charge all the way.
