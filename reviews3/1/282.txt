It basically has the same recording quality as a mic you would usually find attached to a "gaming" headset, just on a swing arm n stabilizer. Has no driver except the one it comes with so there's no way to edit any settings besides your standard settings, and even at it's low price it's best to just save up for a more well known brand if looking for quality over urgency/need.
