The box is on the small side and made of such thin plastic that it was a struggle to get the thing to stay in place during set up. The top is held on with cheap plastic tabs that will break if you continue to open and close the box, like if you want to turn off the power switch on your power strip or take your phone charger with you on a trip. Unless you're going to set it up and never touch it again, don't buy this box. It's actually so difficult to open again that this could be a desirable feature if you are looking to make your power strip less accessible to a child or pet. Another thing to note is that the cord slots are not centered on the ends, which may or may not suit your set-up. There are three cord slots, one in the middle of a long side and two others on the same side where the box curves toward the short ends.
