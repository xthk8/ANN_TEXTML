I bought the case in March 2022 and it seemed ok for what I paid for it. The key chain part did not seem that great so I replaced it a week or so after getting it. As time went on the top cover part stopped staying attached to the case and would just hang loose. Eventually the AirPods Pro case started falling out of the silicone case and luckily every time it did I was at home and it did not break -- this happened a few times. I started carrying my AirPods Pro in my pocket because when you walk it will swing back and forth and the risk of it falling out was greater. I should have replaced it sooner, but it is the 1st week of May 2022 and I moved on to another case. It might work great for others and it is an expensive case, but for protecting something of value, like my AirPods, I will have to pass on it.
