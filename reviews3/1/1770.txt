Worked perfectly fine as intended for around 6 months before cutting in and out every other week and then not working at all. Originally had been using with a pixel 6 and the description doesn't cover that so I had assumed I had misused it, but the seller clarified it's supposed to work with a pixel 6. Which is true.... for around 6 months.Not sure if it's a quality control issue or just my particular one broke pretty quickly, but it's definitely worth getting one from a different seller that would last much longer.
