I liked that this car cell phone holder has multiple options to hold your phone in the car. I am using the air vent version. I have a very thick case on my phone (I use it as a wallet as well) and it works well holding the width, height, and thickness. However, using the air vent attachment the phone tilts down. It won't stay centered because it uses a ball attachment. This touches my music volume control or other controls or gets in the way of controls. If it didn't tilt down it would be perfect. The holder has fallen to the floor every time I used it because there is not enough support for the phone. It's dangerous as this happens while driving.
