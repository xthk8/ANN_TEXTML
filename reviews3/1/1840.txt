When used in my Hero 10 this causes the GoPro to misbehave in a variety of ways, including locking up, aborting recording after a few seconds, etc. The GoPro sometimes complains, at power-on time, that the card is not V30 compatible.I've had issues with SanDisk memory cards in the past. This is sadly just the latest. I only bought this because it was on sale and I hoped that their top-tier model (Extreme Pro) wouldn't be as dodgy as their others. I was wrong.I have no issues with Lexar, PNY, and Samsung cards of various capacities & models, in a variety of GoPros & DJI drones.
