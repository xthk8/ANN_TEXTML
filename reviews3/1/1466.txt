I bought these for when my airpods are charging due to my cat eating the cords on the last (branded) Apple pair I had. Completely ruined my last pair and 2 for $22 seemed like a good idea since the cat attacks anything string-adjacent. I talk to my friends nightly and like to have a wired pair because they don't have to charge.I plug these in and immediately my friends are like 'is that you? you sound like you're at the bottom of a well! Are you talking through a tin can on a string?' I recorded a bit because I thought they were joking, but they couldn't have been more right. I haven't tried listening to music with them but know I will be returning these based off the voice-call quality alone.
