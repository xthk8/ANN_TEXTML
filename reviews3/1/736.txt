I was excited about the features of this item- the spacing of the outlets, the length and the braided cord. I should have read the reviews about it stopping working after a month. I'm sitting here and it literally shut off a month to the day of purchase. I've had the same things plugged into it- nothing new. It says circuit breaker shut off but there's no way to reset it and it's not coming back on. Amazon is sending a replacement but I'll be looking for another one. In the meantime, sitting in the dark- TV, lamp, phone and tablet no where to plug in. Thanks alot.
