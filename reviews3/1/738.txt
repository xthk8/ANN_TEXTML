I purthis back in December 21'. The USB never worked, which was fine because the outlets worked and I needed them more than USB. I finally found another power stip and went to switch them out. I figured since I was changing them out and no longer currently using the One Beat, I'd open it and see if I could figure out why my USB side didn't work. So when I cracked it open I was surprised when I saw a burn mark on the inside. Never again! So freaking Dangerous! I am so lucky my house hasn't burned down. Thank goodness I only used it for a craft room and not a kitchen.
