When I used it the first time, it short circuited a little and the remote as glitchy, but I was mostly satisfied. Unplugged and disassembled everything to put it back in the box. A week later, I reassemble everything for a second use. Light on the remote came on but no light from the ring despite fiddling with the remote for 30 minutes. I now have a selfie stick with a useless piece of dead technology. Thanks!
