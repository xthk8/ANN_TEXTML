Bought 3x 40ft cables but had to return them. Don't know why they're even allowed to sell these. Worked fine in my initial tests but failed when I actually needed them. I found out afterward that HDMI is questionable above 15 feet, and trash 30 feet and above.So yeah, the shorter ones from this brand might be fine, but avoid the 30ft and above ones!
