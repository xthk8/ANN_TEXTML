These cords look just like apple charging cords only longer. They don’t fit into USB ports correctly, they are a little bit smaller. The are constantly falling out of my USB ports. When I get them to stay in they hardly charge. I plugged my iPad in when it had 10% battery left. I closed all the apps and shut it down completely. 12 hours later it only had 30% battery and had not been used at all. Same happened with my husbands and my phones. I only recommend if you can’t get ahold of the apple cords or are in a desperate bind just be prepared to have your device plugged in all the time
