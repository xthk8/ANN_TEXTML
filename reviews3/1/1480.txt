Ordered a card for my Europe trip in May. Seemed to work fine in camera, which was a Sony A7 IV. After importing the photos, I realized about half of the RAW files and a third of the JPEGs were corrupted, with colored lines or patches running across the image - unsalvageable. Bought the same card in a photography store recently and made sure to check it was useable. It was.Very disappointed that most my photos from the trip won't be useable thanks to a corrupt card. Please quality check these products better.
