My current job requires testing across a variety of devices. At any point in the day, you'll find my desk littered with laptops, phones and tablets. I've tried a few different stands to make it easier to swap from iPhone to Android tablet to iMac and back to tablet before picking up an iPad or Windows phone. These are the worst stands on my desk.At the least, they should just hold a device vertically enough to look at the screen. As long as you're careful in how you place the device in the stand, they do that well enough. If you're not careful, it will tip over. There's not enough weight in the bottom to lever against the weight of the device. At best, you can sit a phone in it. It will tip over if you try to use the phone but it will hold the phone. You can sometimes get it to hold tablet but don't even think about trying to use the tablet while it's in the stand.There are better options with better weighting and adjustable angles. Other options that wont tip over if you want to use the device while it's in the stand. Other options that are versatile enough to serve as a tablet stand.
