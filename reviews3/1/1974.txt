I owned the Original Vista earbuds for years, until i managed to damaged the left bud. with the great experience with those i figured i should just upgrade to the current model. Oh how wrong i wasThe Jaybird App has been left to dry for months if not over a year from what i can gather online. So upon getting them you get to make the decision of. Either be able to play sound consistently, or get the cool new features. You need the app to use the features like ANC. But if you use the App everytime there's an "App swap" like if you get a notification or a text. the audio turns off and you have to go back to your music player and restart it. and if you wanted to look at any other apps your out of luck.i eventually gave up on using any of the features just to get consistent sound out of them. but they still had frequent connection issues. and this week the left bud decided that connection to any device was a big no no. After following both the guides on their site and some other forums. i decided to try a factory reset. BOY that was a mistake, now the case recognizes that it is indeed charging both earbuds. but if you try to pair them to any device or reset them in any compacity. it acts like the buds aren't there and won't move forward with pairing or reseting.now waiting to hear back from either Jaybird or a online forums to see if someone else found a fix but as of now i have a $150 paper weight.if jaybird actually took the week it would take to fix the software issues these buds would be a 5/5 stars. but the company has done their best to completely ruin an otherwise amazing product to the point of being unusable
