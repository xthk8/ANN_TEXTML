I have been using plantronics wired headset for work and wanted to switch to wireless. This product had so many good reviews and was on many lists as best for office and phone use. They were so quite I had to have them at 100% volume. I still couldn’t hear well. The speakers did poorly with noise cancelling around me. The headset also didn’t fit well too big for my head. If I bent over or leaned too much they would just fall off. My head as far as I can tell is normal sized so this was frustrating. I used them for a couple weeks and finally got frustrated I couldn’t hear anything people were saying on the other line. I had to ask them to repeat almost all information. I did a hard reset it didn’t work.. then I had to figure out how to reconnect the dongle no big deal. I looked up other ways to help with audio. I tried to plug it in and use it that way. Still way too quite with max 100 volume. Finally decided to return them. I’m not sure if mine were defective but, I read other reviews complaining about the audio volume when trying to trouble shoot my problems.
