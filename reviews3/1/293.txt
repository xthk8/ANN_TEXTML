This mic is not for singing unless you sing like Billie Eilish (super quiet mid range and soft) would be okay for podcasts or gaming if you want to sound like Ohio, my iphone quality has proven to be better for recording than this mic, i would suggest investing in a more expensive mic for these type of things, i returned this mic immediately after i tried it
