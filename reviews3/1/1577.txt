Didn't mind it came in the brown box as opposed to shelf white box, I've seen it come that way from bulk office purchases, etc. However, something didn't seem right, the protective screen wasn't on properly, bubbles and sideways, etc. The usb cord wasn't tied nice and neat like new, looked at the plugs closely and noticed slight wear, maybe testing, most likely not.After a few days of use, went to Plantronics site to register, noticed the warranty start date was Nov 2, 2019, end date Nov 2, 2020. I purchased this item on April 1, 2020. It shouldn't have even been on the site as showing as registered, let alone, 4 months prior. Checked out some reviews, saw a similar case, they got a registered product as well. This item was PRE-OWNED. A PRE-OWNED headset, where someone has stuck this in their ear. I'm not overly squeamish about stuff, unless there are unknowns, I don't want to stick anything in my ear that has resided inside some rando.Amazon is replacing, they say it has to be from the same seller. Hopefully this one will be new, but I'll always wonder if. Seller is CADDY CHEST. Not saying don't buy from them, just check the product when you get it. If it is pre-owned, say it is pre-owned, don't sell things advertised as NEW if not NEW.TLDR: check if new, seller CADDY CHEST. Not the first case with them.Product review: love it, comfortable, sound, mic, and features are all nice. Both bluetooth and USB toggle work well.
