I bought this because I wanted to make some patch cables and I don’t need 200 ft of bulk cable. Big mistake. This has more plastic than copper wire. I’m betting each twisted pair is made of a single or double strand of copper. If you kink this thing it will be toast. If you roll over it with your computer chair it will be toast. It is so flimsy I can barely get the wires right for an RJ45 crimp adapter. I do not recommend this brand wire for anything unless you treat it like a princess. Even then I would avoid. Shame on me for being cheap.
