What I liked was of course what I like about all of fuji cameras. I love the layout of the controls, I love the color science and the appearance of the images.What I did not like was the fact that this was missing the printed manual and that the spring in the battery compartment had been bent over and smashed so that it would not eject the battery.I suspect that this had been returned to amazon and that it had not been properly inspected.
