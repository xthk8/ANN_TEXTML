I have had two clear Popsockets & both of them broke at the base within a few months. They are not as well made or as durable as the black/white Popsockets. Although the stick is really good the clip at the base breaks very easily and you can see that the white base is thicker and more durable than the clear one.I have had several Popsockets now both black, white & now clear ones. The only reason I had to buy more is because I bought a new iPhone so I needed a new case & another Popsocket. Other then that I would have had my blk or wht Popsockets still glued on to my cases.**FYI use a credit card to get the base off your case it works every time! Just slide it over and across.Glad I recently bought a white Popsocket to replace the clear one that broke!So please donâ€™t waste your money like I did, on clear ones. They also get yellow really fast!! Stick to the black and white Popsockets pun intended ; )
