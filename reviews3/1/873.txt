Unfortunately these were not a hit with my family. My wife tried them first but found them too touchy and hard to control (very hard to pause/unpause) and is buying another product similar to the airbud clones she was using previously. My daughter then tried them to replace her Tozo T10's which quit working in one ear after about a year and a half. She said the sound quality when playing music was significantly worse than her T10's. So, my advice is to skip the A2 and go with the T10's or above, or try another company.
