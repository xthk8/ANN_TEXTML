Just to put this review into context, I am the definition of a novice. I got this kit along with the Celestron StarSense Explorer (which is great!) for me and my kids who are 5 & 3 and my understanding about telescopes and optics is zero. I thought the higher the number the more the power. For the unaware novice this seems like a great deal. A nice case, all the eye pieces, filters, how can you go wrong? Unfortunately for a beginner like myself, or kids, this is not an ideal setup. The eye relief (the hole you look through) on the higher power eye pieces (the lower numbers) makes them almost useless. The hole is soooooo small you can’t really use this unless your eye is smashed against the lenses. If you wear eyeglasses you can just forget about it. Small kids? Good luck. The filters, while cool, add little value and really you only need the moon filter, especially on a midrange telescope. I sent this back and purchased the Celestron Zoom eyepiece which can zoom from 8-24mm, a nicer 5mm (Celestron X-CEL LX) eyepiece and a moon filter for about the same price and they are WAY better for the money. The Zoom eyepiece even though it has drawbacks is much better for a beginner since you can focus in at your objects rather then fumbling abound with multiple eyepieces in the dark, loosing the object you were focusing on and then spending time trying to find it again. You also may not even need the higher power eyepieces depending on your telescope and it’s maximum usable magnification. It also comes with a Barlow lense (which doubles the strength of the eyepiece being used) but again, adds little value since if you double the power on the stronger eyepieces you will most likely be overpowering your telescope and won’t be able to see anything anyway. The 32mm eyepiece in this kit is actually really nice, but again, not needed if you already have a 25MM that came with your telescope.
