This cable did it's job just fine initially but one month later it's starting to fail and doesn't charge at all most of the time. The phone end of the connector looks it it's starting to come apart and and separating from the cable a bit. Looking at other reviews now it looks like this could have been worse. Not sure it's worth saving a few dollars. I'll just stick to Anker.
