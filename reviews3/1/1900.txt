Reached out and still no response from the seller. I’m out $$ and bummed. It’s been more than a month now. What a waste:(I was so excited for this product. It was ok at first. It wasn’t as flexible as I wished, but it worked. I went to bend it in a different position and it snapped. I wasn’t bending it crazy or misusing it. I’m disappointed. Maybe it was just a defective one. I’m going to reach out to get it replaced, but it’s 4 days past the return time. I’ll update if it’s replaced and works better the next go round.
