I thought I’d give these a shot. They looked cute and had a decent amount of good reviews. I’ve never tried the buttonless ones before but I thought it was cool.But I was wrongFirst, they connected and worked just fine. But about an hour later, after I charged them, only one headphone would connect at a time. It would go back and forth between the left working and the right not working, to the right working and the left not workingWhen they finally connected, the volume kept turning up, blowing out my ear drums and I kept fighting to turn it down. This is due to the sensitivity of them being buttonless so you just tap the outside. Idk if it was my hair or ear setting it off but it wouldn’t stop until I adjusted them until they were nearly falling out of my earOn top of they, they go really deep into your ear and it hurts, especially if you have smaller ears. I was worried the rubber end would get stuck inside my ear when I tried taking them off.Don’t waste your money on this, regular headphones are so much better, I don’t even know why I tried out the “fancy” wireless headphones not worth the price
