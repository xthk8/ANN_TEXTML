Let me start by saying, I own the wyze cam pan V1, such a great little camera...lasted me for many years, I even set it up outside the house for a whole year ( protected from rain of course ), and when I took it back inside the house it was dirty, yellowish, but still worked, an it STILL works to this day..So when I saw the version 2 of the camera, with color night vision, better image quality and all the improvements they made after years of selling the first one and for the same price...It was a no brainer for me.What a huge mistake....this camera took away sooooo many hours of my life trying to make this work...when I first got it, it worked flawlessly for a while, but on the very first day there was a firmware update available and I chose not to update it for a while...my theory is, don't fix what is not broken..But that update warning everyday on the screen was starting to bug me, so I took my chances and went for the update...Should have listened to my gut feeling, the update turned this camera into a $50 paper weight.But not your average $50 paper weight....not your regular brick oh no...This camera is now a sentimental, full of personality freaking brick...let me explain..I have spent countless hours going through every single walkthrough trying to troubleshoot this beast, even went as far as buying a good micro SD card to try to install an older version of the firmware ...tried every single think the wyze people advise on their website, plus a bunch of other stuff...now here is the funny part, after trying MANY combinations of different power bricks and cables, sometimes the camera would go past the solid red light and go into setup mode....but it wouldn;t scan the QR code,Simply put, this camera would initiate or not initiate setup at random, sometimes it did like a certain combination of cable and adapter, sometimes it would reject this one in favor of another combination,..sometimes it would go into setup mode on one outlet but not read the QR code, and sometimes it would reject this wall plug in favor of a different one on the other side of the house...But it would NEVER scan the QR a code !So after more than 10 hours total invested in this brick, I gave up.....specially after reading other reviews and other people saying that the firmware broke de camera.....the dreaded solid red light...Called amazon who said that they couldn't put me into contact with the wyze people, but they could offer me a refund...So I took it....and now, after all this stress and money wasted, I have to hop on my bike and go all the way to some freaking market so I can send this worthless brick back home...out of my expense, my time and my patience....Listen here people, bad things happen in life, stuff breaks, malfunctions etc...I'm not mad because my toy broke...The reason I'm mad is because wyze is selling this crap knowing full well that their firmware is messed up...they even have a note on the firmware update page that reads ''Note: This firmware is halted because the support for offset time zones caused microSD card recording failure. We apologize for the issue and are working to resolve it.;''on another firmware update it says ''Note: This firmware is paused while we look into reports of the rotate 180 degrees setting needing to be reapplied every time the user enters the live stream page.''they are having serious problems with the software for this camera, but you're not gonna see any of that right here on their product page are U?? NO SIR...here everything is pretty and shiny ...no mention of that....So there u have it....buy this camera....update it.....say goodbye to your 50 bucks...Now, check this out ,,,,,as I was writing this review I had this intense urge to just hammer this cam to pieces, but before I did that, I decided to give one final try....took some random cable and plug it in...can u guess what happened???that's right.... IT WORKED !!!! the freaking thing worked...even scanned the QR code...I was even able to see live view from it....I just couldn't believe it..but the problem was, it was on the wrong spot in the house, not where I need it surveilling, so my only choices were to just leave it there filming nothing, or unplug it and move it to the right spot...and that's what I did...Can u guess what comes next....??that's right.....solid red light of death again...so I rushed and took it back to the spot where it had just worked, with the same cable, on the same outlet.....where it had just worked 3 minutes ago....and it is BROKEN AGAIN !!!!!!!this camera is alive and wants u to lose your freaking mind !!!!!!!Now I want my money back....!!!!! and I wanna make sure that every single person I know will hear about my experience with this camera....by the way....during the days I was trying to fix this camera, I went and bought a KASA pan cam, and a blink outside cam....they all work as they should...The KASA cam has a 2k version that blows this camera out of the water in every way but one...the ''patrol mode'' is too long for each spot on the kasa cam...the wyze cam stays for only 10 seconds at each spot, and I prefer that over the 1 minute that the kasa cam has...Anyway, don't buy this brick.....you will be renting your own frustration.....U will pay a company to have your time wasted, only you don't know that until the very end....the least they could have done for me is take their brick back and send me the old wyze pan cam as a replacement...and make would make sure never to update their firmware...by the way...you can watch live view on the alexa app with the old camera.....but not with the new one, because u know...taking features away from u is what updates are for these days .the old wyze cam pan was just too good to be true...the new one is worth a bucket of hippopotamus excrement
