Worked fine at first. Can transmit a gigabit per second but can't have a plastic tab strong enough to continue keeping the plug in place. I've used ethernet cables before that could be moved from one jack to another without the plastic tab failing. This one lasted perhaps 10 or 20 moves from one jack to another. When it first started failing, it just required a little extra effort to triple check that it was inserted correctly. Eventually, it was no longer possible to keep connected. A finicky ethernet connection is worse than none at all. Conveniently, Amazon will gladly sell you another inexpensive cable
