While assembling the mount one of the riveted studs in the plate that holds the two sides of the mount together and to the stand snapped off. The studs are also covered in a thick paint that makes using the provided wrench impossible to use without hurting yourself. I had to get out my own wrench to even get any of the studs past the first rotation. The stud that snapped, snapped when the nut was about halfway down, so it did not snap due to over tightening. If you buy this mount do yourself a favor and sand the paint off the studs.
