At first I was impressed by the sturdiness of this gooseneck. But in trying to use it in various positions nearly every day I've found that it's too strong and takes considerable effort to get it into position. Today I was trying to nudge it a bit to adjust my camera and guess what? The clamp that holds the phone snapped. I applaud the people who made this for listening to customers who complained about flimsy goosenecks, but unless you're putting it somewhere and never intentionally moving it then I would look elsewhere.
