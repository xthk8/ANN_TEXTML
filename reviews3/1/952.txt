Purpose: external microphone for a Logitech Mevo camera for use during live stream.This microphone had so much white noise and such poor audio pickup, even at full gain and output settings on my camera, it was useless.The onboard microphone on the Logitech camera is multiple times better. I don't know how that is possible. Even in an environment with noise, the Logitech could pick up my voice just fine.This movo shotgun mic couldn't properly pick me up from 6 feet away.So I tested it on my desktop. The reality is, it seems impossible to use this mic at any reasonable distance away from it. Even on a desktop with infinite recording settings, you won't be picking up a voice if you are more than a few feet away. And then there is that persistent hissing noise (white noise).Ultimatly returning this item and continuing to use the onboard mic on my Logitech for now.
