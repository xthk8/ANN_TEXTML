Microphone is scratchy and doesn't work half the time. When it does work its low, muffled and robotic; people keep complaining and yelling speak up and stop whispering. Playback in the earpiece is restricted to 44hz in windows 10 and on android. It may support Bluetooth 5.2 but I've thoroughly tested it and the firmware is more like 2.1edr. It must have a cheap dac or something because the wireless range is great but the audio quality coming and going is the worst. If you need people to be able to hear you look elsewhere. I'm not even a trucker, I just sit at a desk working the phone and this headset can't keep up. There's also about a 2 second lag when someone talks and it can make conversations rocky. Also no duh it isn't noise cancelling, in order for a headset to be noise cancelling it either needs 2 earmuffs or 2 outer microphones with 0-latency frequency cancelling circuits which alone would make the headset cost another $100. You will never ever have noise cancelling with only one earpiece and one ear wide open; that alone should have been a big enough red flag to let you (and me) know to steer clear, the fact that they would falsely advertise that its capable of cancelling any noise using just one earpiece.
