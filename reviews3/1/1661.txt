Despite some negative reviews, there were so many positive ones I was willing to try them. I mostly wanted them for sleeping (I am a side sleeper) and some when I am up in the morning. When I first tried them out my husband could hear sound coming from them (never had this problem with other headphones before). I realized that if I wore them so both speakers were even over both ears, neither one of them was actually over my ear canal, so I had to turn up the volume to hear anything which resulted in my husband hearing sound coming from them. When I positioned them so one of the speakers was over my ear canal then the sound was much better and I could turn it down, but this resulted in the other speaker being behind my other ear and completely useless, except to put pressure behind my ear.When laying down it was only comfortable if the speaker was directly over my ear canal, which meant I could only hear from the speaker that I was laying on. Not a big deal, I was able to have the volume down, but it was annoying to have the speaker behind my ear and when I would turn over, then I would have to readjust the headband for the other speaker to be directly on that ear. I tried them for a few nights trying to see if I could get used to it and make it work, but the longer I used it the more annoyed I became and I decided to return them and try out another brand.I began wondering if I just have a weird shaped head, so I tried them on several others to compare and at first glance it looks like the speakers are by the ears, but same thing, when adjusting so they are actually at the part of the ear to hear, the other speaker would be behind the ear.
