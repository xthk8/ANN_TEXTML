When you put theses headphones into noise cancelling mode they'll work perfect for an hour or two. After that it starts making white noise like you're brushing the microphone. It gets progressively louder and louder. Eventually it starts making really loud popping sounds that hurt your ears. Sony support suggests just turning off noise cancelling. That does stop the noise, but then what's the point of expensive noise cancelling earbuds?! This is the second pair I've gotten with the same problem.
