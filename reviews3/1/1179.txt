I bought the like new, stated it would come in the original box but the box may be damaged. Ok, no problem. I got no box at all, the cords were wrapped around the base and all of the parts were just in a plastic bag. I have no paperwork and no instructions and super bonus……no power cord. I’m not getting a “like new” vibe here at all and I now have a useless product.
