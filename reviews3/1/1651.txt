On the surface, the idea is great. The tripod is very easy to extend and fold up again, and having a remote is nice, but if you're looking for something that you'll be using for a while - keep scrolling.The material is cheap plastic. I've used it maybe 20 times, at best, and two pieces already broke - I managed to glue it together the first time and am hoping to again. If you put any torque or strain or pressure on it, it just breaks.The remote is a great idea, but I didn't find myself using it as much as I expected. It connects to my phone easily, but that connection turns off very quickly - so you think you're starting a video or taking a photo, but nothing happens (unless you just click the button every short period of time to make sure it's still active). I eventually found myself running back to my phone every time I wanted to film just to confirm that it actually activated... Kind of defeats the purpose.Summary: you get what you pay for.
