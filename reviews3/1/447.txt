I tired laminating two ID cards with these laminating pouches and my Scotch laminator. The laminating pouch curled up and went into the laminator. I am currently trying to take my laminator apart to get the sheet out. Do not buy these if you would like use them with your Scotch laminator. Stick with Scotch. I learned my lesson.
