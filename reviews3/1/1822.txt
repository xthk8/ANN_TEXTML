I used to love my Brother printer. I never had problems with it. I had it in storage for a few months, with the old ink cartridges removed, and after I moved two weeks ago, I got my work station all set up again. First things first, I order new ink cartridges, because I anticipate needing to print both text documents and photographs as part of critical science reports for work. The photos do not need to be professionally printed, but they are required to show detail and be basically the correct color of the environment in which they were taken in order to support the documentation they accompany.The first time I tried to print photos, they came out a sort of strange washed out gray-blue-green. No matter, I thought, it must be a problem with my printer settings, or maybe the printer needs to run through its cleaning cycle again. After multiple adjustments, double-checking the printer settings, and trying various types of printer paper (glossy photo, regular printer paper, etc.), I can only conclude that the color printer cartridges I was sent are either not genuine or the manufacturing quality has seriously decreased since the last time I bought ink.Black ink printing for text documents is not affected. Given the colors of the photos that resulted from my tests, my guess is that the problem is with the yellow cartridge, the magenta cartridge or both. The blues and greens in the photos, while not correct, are at least present. There's a hint that pinks and reds are showing, though not well. There appears to be literally no yellows or oranges at all--in fact, those colors seem to be muddy, almost gray.As a result, portions of my weekly report for work have been delayed. I have wasted time and money trying to sort out what's wrong with my printer. And now, I will have to go to Staples or Kinko's to pay for a few decent photos. I will be asking for my money back and registering a complaint.
