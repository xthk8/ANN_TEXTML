I ordered a two-pack of these earphones. Now, I wasn’t expecting them to be the best since it was two of them for a cheap price but they’re practically unusable. First off, they need to be connected toBlue tooth which I wasn’t expecting but whatever. The person on the other end sounds like they’re muffled or underwater. Both of the ear phones are faulty. My sister got one for my mom as well at the same time as I ordered mine and they were faulty as well. DO NOT BUY.
