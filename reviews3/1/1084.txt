As an IT Pro I find this product to be extremely sketchy and I will not be using it. In all my years of IT I have never seen a usb device like this that has it's own internal storage and an EFI boot partition. The internal partition of the usb drive contains the needed drivers in an exe application installed for the adapter to function. The disturbing part to me is the readme file instructs the user to disable any anti-virus so the driver installer works correctly when run. Since I cannot find a standalone inf files to manually install drivers for this device and I have safety concerns about running this unknown exe driver installer on my system I will not be using this device. Not saying this exe would do anything bad to my system but this whole driver install process is making my IT Spidey sense tingling in a bad way so I'm walking away from this device and finding a different product instead of this one.
