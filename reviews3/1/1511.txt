This product isn't as advertised. It says it is Apple Certified but it IS NOT! It is not Plug and Play. When I attached the adaptor to my iPhone, iPad and MacBookPro, it did not sync or mirror my devices. The TV screen showed a QR code that I needed to scan, download an app from the Apple App Store. I did so and then opened the app and clicked on mirror mode. The app just hung and did nothing. Frustrated after so many tries, I packaged it right back up and sent it back to Amazon (thank you for the easy return process Amazon) and the purchased an Authentic Apple HDMI to Lightning adaptor.
