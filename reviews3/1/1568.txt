This item was almost fully assembled with the last step being to add the television. It was sitting on a table and out of nowhere the glass base exploded! I'm so grateful no one was on the room or injured. I purchased two but I'm definitely not going to use the other one I bought. I was up late sweeping and wiping up glass and this morning with the assistance of the sunlight, I was able to find more small shards of glass. I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase. I have no plans of unboxing the other one and I wish to return it.
