This is the second Jabra wireless headset I've purchased, the first one being their slightly more premium Jabra Evolve 75. That one lasted nine months, while less six five months with my Jabra Evolve 65 and the right speaker is out, it's not charging consistently (think the pins in the micro-USB port must be getting worn/misaligned), and customers regularly complain that I sound echoey. I opened a ticket with Jabra customer support, but their RMA process was so cumbersome last time that I probably won't bother. For a premium product from a well-known brand preferred by a lot of companies, it's disappointing I've had so many quality and service issues with Jabra.
