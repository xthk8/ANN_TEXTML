I purchased these to use in my car driving. I opened one and put the other two unopened in the glovebox. The first one died in about three weeks. I got in the car one morning and it wouldn't charge. I tried cleaning the connectors, cleaning the iphone socket, changing the USB charger. Nothing. Opened up the second one. Works fine and then got in the car one morning about four weeks later...nothing. Not sanguine about how the third one is going to work. Save your money.
