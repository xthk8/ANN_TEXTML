I went to clean my earbuds using a small, prepackaged alcohol swab, and the eartips completely disintegrated. I did not soak them in alcohol, nor did I use an aggressive tool - I literally just used a prepackaged alcohol swab like they use at the doctor's office, and these tips fell apart.For what it's worth, I did like these eartips, but I would also say that they were not as good as the standard Comply tips that fit most other in-ear headphones - the universal ones that are shaped like a cylinder with a rounded top. I have those on another set of non-Apple earbuds, and I love them. But Comply can't help the fact that Apple designed the charge case for the AirPods Pro in such a way that Comply can't use their normal shape of eartips. That's Apple's fault; Comply has to make an eartip that will fit inside the case.
