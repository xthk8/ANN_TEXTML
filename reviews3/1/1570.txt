I have used plantronics headsets for two decades with my voip without issue. When I had to replace my last one I was saddened to see that they don’t really make that model anymore. So I purchased this one. The ear piece is extremely bulky and hard to wear if you wear glasses. But I could get past that. The real issue is the connectivity. If you walk 5ft away and put a wall between you and the device, it repeatedly disconnects and reconnects. Distance from base is something I always look at and bought this one b/c of the long distance from base. I have been able to walk around with all my other plantronics, even going outside our building, with no issue. This one is horrible. If all you do is sit at your desk and never move, this is a fine headset. If you walk around and want mobility away from your computer, don’t buy this headset.
