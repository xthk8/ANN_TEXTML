I bought one of these last year and it was great. Super fast transfer speeds.I then accidentally left it in a hotel, so bought another. It had this weird issue where it'd transfer at 100% speed, then just ... stop... for about 30 seconds. Then it'd transfer at full speed again, and stop.I returned it for another. I went through FIVE, from four different sellers, that had the exact same issue. Tested on 3 different computers and an iPad. The only reason I stuck with it was because the first one worked so well and it's hard to find usb-c UHS-II card readers for some reason.I went with one by ugreen recently, it works perfectly.
