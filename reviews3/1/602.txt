Liked it at first, handy and used it every day at work. I’ve had it for about a month and the plastic bumpers are already migrating off the stand. They don’t come off easily and where they were originally is really sticky. So I guess I need to find some goo remover and figure something out, as once those are gone my phone will be bumping up against metal every time. Bummer
