Other products like this one are far superior. The arm is far to sturdy and the grip is weaker than other similar products - which means that if you try to do a fine adjustment of the arm after you clamp it, you have use force that ends up causing it to become unclamped.... I tried tightening the clamp further and then it just broke the clamp! The first time I got one of these, it was this brand - the part that holds your device broke in about 2 months - that can cause significant damage to your device when it falls out, if it wan't already messed up during set-ups. Three major flaws that compliment each other - total design failure and product - needs negatibe stars. Get ANYTHING OTHER BRAND than this one!
