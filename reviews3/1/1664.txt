First Musicozy I had lasted a year until the charge port broke, second set lasted about a month until charging port broke. They finally came up with a USB C port which is great except after about 2 weeks the 2 hour charge only lasts about 10 minutes then prompts low battery and shuts off. Not a good track record. Bought a pair of replacement components and can't put them in because the speakers are hard wired and sewn in so all around garbage product
