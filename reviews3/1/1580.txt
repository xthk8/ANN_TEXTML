I wish I could rate this a zero. I had been using this cord on my Macbook Air for a few years. It would cause issues with my display sometimes where the laptop screen would turn black or not fit the correct size of the projected screen. A week few weeks ago I tried using it to watch Disney + and my laptop's display flashed, then turned black and my laptop would not turn back on. Prior to this my laptop was running perfectly fine with no issues. I talked to Apple support on the phone and I brought my laptop to the Geek Squad at Best Buy and they said that either my laptop's video card, a capacitor on my logic board, or GPU was shot, likely from a malfunction from the AmazonBasics thunderbolt cord. They told me I am better off getting a new laptop, which I cannot afford. Just found out AmazonBasic's products have multiple destructive reviews from customers saying this is a common issue with their products. CNN did an investigation on it too. I wish I had bought a better cord made by a different brand and still had my laptop today.
