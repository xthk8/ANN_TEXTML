I wasted my dollars on these, as they do NOT work with the Microsoft Surface 4 Pro. If you plug two of these in the Surface Dock, and connected them to two monitors, the amount of issues that come into play is massive.1. Pretty much zero chance of using the Surface 4 Pro screen together with the two monitors. Monitors keep turning on and off, making the Windows 10 ding every time. If you close the cover on the Surface, you might get the two monitors to work2. The monitors work occasionally, but more often than not, you'd have to get into display settings and re-enable one or the other.3. Monitors keep waking up with the message "No input received" and then going back to sleep, waking up 20 seconds later.All this was solved buy buying two "active" mini-display port to HDMI adapters, and two HDMI cables. My Surface was up to date, my Surface Dock was up to date, and replacing the cables solved all of the issues above.I presume these would work well for many other devices, but Amazon claims that these work with Surface Pro models.
