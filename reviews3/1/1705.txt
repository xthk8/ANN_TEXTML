So I made the mistake of not really using the headphones to much when I got them. I originally bought them to replace a different pair of headphones that was lost but later found. When I use these headphones there kinda like a high pitch sound. I have played with them for a little bit but can't get it to go away. I went on here to see if I could still return them just to find out I missed the return by not even a whole 7 hours. I've never had a problem with getting refurbished items from Amazon before so I naturally just trusted these would be fine. I guess I had to learn the hard way.
