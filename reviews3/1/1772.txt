I was hopeful for this little phone dongle. I have a Pixel and a car without bluetooth, so I always had to choose between charging my phone and listening to podcasts or music (or even directions from my maps app).This thing will almost always charge my phone, but the audio out is extremely unreliable. It'll last only 5-10 seconds max before the audio cuts out. I've fiddled with it long enough, and am counting this as a lost cause.
