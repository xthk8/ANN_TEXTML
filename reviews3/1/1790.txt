I was excited to try this mic. The package comes with 2 mics, a lightning dongle, 2 clips and 1 USB C cable for charging the mics. There is no case included.I was able to plug in the dongle and get the mics to work very quickly. Setup was smooth and fast. I can't speak to the sound quality of the mic. From the few minutes that I have tried, it sounded fine - nothing very notably good or bad.But my main gripe is in the design of the clips. The clips slide onto these flimsy slots on the mics, and those slots are very easy to break. Within the first 30mins, I already broke it by accident with not much force, trying to reposition the clip.Very disappointing, and I will sending it back as I don't think they should break that easily. If you don't plan on ever using the clips, this will probably work fine for you.
