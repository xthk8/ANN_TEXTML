Loved the design and the appearance from the pictures, but it felt lightweight and flimsy out of the box. First one stopped working within a day. Replacement never worked. Scarily, as I was boxing it up for a return the nightlight briefly came on, while it was UNPLUGGED! Very disappointed in what I hoped would be a good desktop power source.
