I bought two pairs at the same time. One for me and one for my partner. For mine- will only pair to my phone if I use the right side earbud, battery for both earbuds last about 20 minutes, and battery life for charging case only lasts for one charge, can’t use either earbud to control any settings, both earbuds turn off or disconnect at random.My partners- same charging/battery issues as mine, within 1 week the magnets in his case were loose and earbuds won’t easily connect to charger, can only control settings from left ear bud.We both find the disc shape of the silicone to fit very uncomfortably.However we both also agree that the noise cancellation is great.Overall, these were not worth the price and have been very frustrating to use daily. I would choose a different brand.
