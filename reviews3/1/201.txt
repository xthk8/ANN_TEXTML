This phone holder worked SO well before it broke....but I'm really disapointed it only lasted four and a half months. I had another one of a similar style that had a joint, which is where it broke after about 6 months. I bought this one because the reviews said it seemed to be more durible because it didn't have a joint. Initially I was really pleased. It's incredibly poseable, versitile and easy to use. Then today I went to move the gooseneck and the whole thing went limp. It appears it broke at the base, similar to the way the last one did. This style is great before it breaks but it seems the internal metal piece just gets worn out quickly. I guess I'll be searching for a different style altogether. I'm just so sick of throwing money away on phone holders that end up in a land fill less than a year after I buy them.... My kingdom for a phone holder that doesn't take up a ton of space, is versitile, and doesn't break.
