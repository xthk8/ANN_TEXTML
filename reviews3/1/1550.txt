The COMPLY tips will not attach to my airpod pro. I watched the videos and it looked simple, but I can't get them to attach. It looks to me like the attachment piece in the COMPLY tips is too small. I wrote the company using their "contact us" form, explained the problem, and asked for help. Got an automated reply that they would get back to me in two days. Two days came and went, and nada. So I sent them another request and got the same automated reply. Two days came and went, and nada. I'm really big on company's responding to you when you have a problem with their product, and COMPLY just isn't interested. So I'll return these COMPLY tips to Amazon. I hate returning products, but these just don't work. Neither does the company.Update: I took my Airpods to Apple and had them replace the tips. It turns out that the soft rubber tip is glued onto a piece of hard plastic (a part of the tip) that clips onto another piece of hard plastic that is part of the Airpod itself. If just the soft rubber part of the tip comes off, though -- which is what happened to me -- it is not obvious that there is a piece of the tip (the piece of hard plastic) still connected to the Airpod itself. So the Apple guy popped that piece of hard plastic part of the tip off and then the new tip snapped right on. I had actually poked around at that hard plastic part of the tip but it didn't readily come off and so I was afraid of breaking the Airpod and didn't work at it too hard. I am still giving the product a 1-star though because the company twice did not respond to my request for help. Had they done so, this whole hastle could have been avoided.
