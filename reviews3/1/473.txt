Bought it 4 months ago and finally got around to using it. Running a direct line from the router to my PC, 25ft, and I'm barely getting 80mbps download. WiFi is significantly faster, and any other cable is giving me close to 500mbps.Too late to return, but it's a piece of junk. It seems it works for some people and not others. Super frustrating. Should've just gone to Lowe's or Walmart.
