Two years ago my boyfriend and I needed a solution when moving into an apartment where we couldn’t mount our 55 inch TV on the wall. I bought these and if your TV isn’t completely flat in back like ours wasn’t, installation is tricky and frustrating. Can’t knock them too much for that because these are probably designed for flat back TVs more than anything. Anyways, the screws were wonky to begin with and the legs were wobbly. I was constantly scared our TV would fall over with the slightest bump. Finally we moved into a new apartment where we can mount our TV on the wall again so we started to remove the legs and the screws would hardly budge. It took us an hour to get these legs off because the screws were so messed up. When we finally got the screws out, they had damaged the holes so badly that we can’t screw our wall mount on. We know this wasn’t an issue with the TV because the screws, like I said, were kind of messed up from the start. I regret buying and installing these. What a headache. These might work for a smaller TV but 55 inches and up? Forget it.
