I am a computer consultant to small law firms for 30+ years. Never have I seen two consecutive genuine manufacturer's toner cartridge go south. In face I've seen only ONE go south in my entire career, and that was a 3rd party refill by a local vender in the 90's. The first of my two recently failed Brother toner cartridges came WITH a brand-new Brother MFL5800dw multifunction printer, so there can be no doubt of the authenticity or origin of the product. To advance troubleshooting, Brother told me to purchase a second, GENUINE toner cartridge. I wish I hadn't listened to them and just bought something cheap to test, but this is for a client and so I didn't screw around. Boy was I sorry. Random splotches on the pages, getting a bit cleaner as the print job progresses, but then first page of next job is dirty again, as others have described in their negative reviews here. The first cartridge was put into service December 2019. The second cartridge, ordered from Amazon, was put into service August, 2020 - so almost assuredly not from the same batch, CLEARLY underscoring a very bad, chronic QC problem at Brother, warranting my warning: DON'T BUY BROTHER PRINTER CARTRIDGES. EVER. I purchased a two pack of Halofox high yield toner cartridges for $22 (!!!) and so far they are BOTH printing beautifully. Oh, Brother!
