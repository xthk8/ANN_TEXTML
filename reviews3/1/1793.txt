Received the product and immediately tried to record videos for my business. The microphone barely picks up your voice. The iPhone microphone is actually about the same quality. The volume was extremely low, and still picked up surrounding noise.I highly recommend either investing in a high-quality one, or simply using your iPhone and suffering through poor audio quality.
