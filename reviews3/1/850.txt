Terrible product. I probably received a defective product, but frankly, I've received a VERY high proportion of defective earbuds from Amazon...One of the earbuds does not work at all; no sound comes out. As for the other one, the volume is very feeble, much weaker compared to other cheap earbuds I've tried. The touch control panel (or whatever it's called) is also buggy.
