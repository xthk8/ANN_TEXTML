First, I ordered Red! Not black. The nightlight points upward, blinding your vision of the sockets. Red sockets, I can see. That's why I ordered Red. I don't wanna waist expensive gas to return & reorder. I was boiling water with electric kettle & used my coffee grinder at the same time & it tripped off. Never happens with my $4.00 Harbor freight power strip. It's charges phones, "Smart "Charging " they claim but it wasn't smart enough to shut off power once it was charged.

Gear for people who know nothing about nothing.
