I am not a fan of this camera. First and worst, in 360 mode, the output files are in a proprietary format that requires an app to post process the video into a format that can be edited on a PC. This app will only run on a computer running windows 10 or 11. So in 360 mode it's a lot of work to get a usable video.UPDATED:After upgrading my PC to win 10, I find that the GoPro player is unable to export a video. I have spent many hours with customer support but at this time, several reps have admitted to me that many users are unable to export videos and it is a big problem. Customer support can only elevate the issue to the engineering team. They have stated many times that they will get back to me with a solution but never do. Therefore, I am forced to return this camera in favor of the install. This has been nothing short of maddening dealing with GoPro!The app for a phone or tablet is very buggy and after you get your video edited, you still cannot convert it to MP4 so it can only be viewed on the tablet.Customer support is non existent and the manual is not very helpful. Instructions for the app don't exist.In hero mode, this camera will make a pretty good video but the 360 mode is very hard to get a good video.This thing eats battery at an alarming rate even when off. If you charge up to 100% and leave it sitting on a table turned off, the next day it will be down to 30%. If you are using it, taking video's, you will be lucky to get 30 minutes before it shuts down due to low battery.It runs hot, it will get very hot when you are taking video's and sometimes, shut down due to overheating if it gets over 96 degrees F.Overall, this camera is not very user friendly in 360 mode but will take a decent video as a normal camera. For the price, there are better options out there.
