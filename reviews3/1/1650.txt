I bought this and it just sat in my closest forever until I took it out maybe 2 weeks ago. A screw came out near the legs and I wasnâ€™t able to adjust them anymore. The having to screw to open the phone holding part was kinda annoying too. Then, it tipped over onto my wall and completely broke. I used to have another tripod that lasted years. was a bit disappointed in how quickly this one fell apart.
