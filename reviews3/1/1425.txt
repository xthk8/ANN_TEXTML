These are terrible. First of all, they require Bluetooth even though they are wired headphones - what is the point of buying wired headphones if they need bluetooth. Second, they don’t even work properly WITH bluetooth. I tried going on a run with both the headphones and a fitness tracker connected to my phone, which is not a problem with other bluetooth headphones, and the whole time the headphones would lower the volume on its own seemingly due to the bluetooth issue so I would have to disconnect my fitness tracker or continue to click the volume up button every second so I could hear my music. Do not buy these, I don’t know why there are any 2 star reviews let alone 5 stars.
