UPDATE: The below review was written a day or two ago (I hadn't yet attempted to replace the tips at the time of writing that review). So, after owning these for only 2 weeks, I just sat down and attempted to replace them a few minutes ago. I've uploaded pictures of what has happened.I'll start by stating that I followed a video on their official website that demonstrates how to remove them. Instead of easily popping off the airpod, they just disintegrated into my finger tips and the part that was clipped into the earpiece seems to be fused into it. I've tried delicately pulling on them with tweezers, but I don't want to damage the airpods in any way. I've reached out to them via their contact form to see if they have any suggestions.$25 for foam tips that only work for about a week and require replacement after 2 weeks is wildly uncool. This should be a huge warning to anyone considering purchasing these. They were fantastic in concept, but fail miserably in execution. I'd be shocked if they don't already know about this issue. I feel duped.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I received these 2 weeks ago. They're impossible to clean if you are someone who generally produces a normal amount of earwax. They start sliding out like the original Apple brand tips. Only receiving 3 pairs, having to replace each pair every 2 weeks, it's just not worth the price! Great concept & they're fabulous during the first week (which is probably when most of the positive reviews were written). Super bummed about this experience because I can't afford to replace them that often!
