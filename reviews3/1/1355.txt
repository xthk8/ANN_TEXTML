I bought this for a road trip from California to New England. The suction lasted until Nevada before having to switch to the vent clip. The loose/tight screw on the vent clip started to fail around Pennsylvania but as long as I didn’t try to adjust it, it would hold the phone ok. Then a few weeks after arriving in New England the adjustment knob broke completely. The plastic just cracked in half. My husband’s $10 novelty vent clip holder that’s shaped like a dog holding the phone has lasted over a year now. This holder has a lot of adjustment angles and can fit a lot of phones but it’s cheap and doesn’t last.
