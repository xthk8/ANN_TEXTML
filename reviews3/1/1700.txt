I didn’t know these headphones were refurbished when purchasing. My mistake. For starters it didn’t come with a charger. The pods were named something personal to the last user. It wouldn’t let me change the name. Also disconnected from the pods and wouldn’t let me connect back. Also the case was completely dead on arrival with no charger. Terrible quality control and honestly lazy. I’m upset I was definitely scammed out of 80 dollars.
