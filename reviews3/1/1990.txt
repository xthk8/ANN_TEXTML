When this charger arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to see that I was one of the "lucky" customers who got the coveted QR code card for a free second charger -- ostensibly only one in 50 boxes has it. I scanned the code and followed the instructions. I got no response and no second charger. I tried several times to no avail.It's probably just as well I did not get a "free" second charger because the charger I bought kept blowing my car's cigarette lighter fuse. The charger would work fine for a while, but every now and then it would blow the fuse. It seemed to happen any time the charger was bumped or jostled -- regardless whether a phone or other device was plugged into it. It blew the fuse less often if I rotated it a quarter turn and kept the ports vertical instead of horizontal. I even tried taping it in place to keep it from blowing the fuse, but that didn't work.After spending far more in replacement fuses than I paid for this charger, I finally decided to see if the problem was with my cigarette lighter or this charger. I bought a fast charger from a different company and it works just fine -- no blown fuses no matter how much I bump or jostle it -- and no matter what I plug into it.If you like wasting your money on fake "free charger" offer scams and blown fuses, then this is the charger for you.
