I hate to leave one star reviews, but figured I should warn others. The product was fine for while and didn't scratch anything, but after awhile somehow the metal part scratched my screen and left a sizable mark. I switched to the other one in the set, but after a few days it started doing the same thing!Luckily I was using a paperlike screen protector, but its still annoying and now I have to buy new ones.
