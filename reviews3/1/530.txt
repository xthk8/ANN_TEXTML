Well, I opened box and pulled out contents... Then attempted to power on... When I saw no lights I thought well maybe it's not that simple as some electronics have a more technical operational procedure lol... Seriously though I read instructions and it started that I should charge headphones for 8 hours prior to using first time. Although I agree first use should start after full charge.. Most headphones will allow use after just a few minutes of charging!! All hypothetical concerning these though bc once I plugged into change no lights came on indicating they were charging at the end of 8+ hours of charging I tried multiple combinations of holding power button although I was pretty confident the item was defective from the start. Bummer bc the reviews indicate a much more optimistic view of the product... As With most overpriced and overhyped products these days they are made with fragile and cheap components and if you're lucky to get them to turn on one of a dozen out so issues soon presents itself to disappoint you and leave you feeling taken advantage of yet again bc they sold this illusion of being satisfied and getting a great deal all at one time.
