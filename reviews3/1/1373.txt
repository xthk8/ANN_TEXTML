This was not worth the money. Normally Brothers advertises that you can get more pages from TN880 than other cartridges. Up to 12000 pages. I always carefully watch my cartridges and page counts. In the past it was about 9000 pages but this last one stopped after only 7000 pages. Why not buy TN850 that supposed to yiel 8000 pages ?
