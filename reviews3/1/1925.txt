I am not one to leave terrible reviews, but when an item has an issue, I make sure to be honest about the experience.I purchased this light as a Christmas gift. The first week after Christmas the item worked as it should. After the first week the light would start to dim after being live for 30 minutes. After a few days of this happening intermittently, the remote/switch lost all of the different lighting modes. After about 10 days, the remote would turn the light off but would not turn the light back on. This was all intermittent until finally the only way to get the unit to turn off and on was via unplugging/plug in.So, the first unit was returned and replaced.The second unit arrived yesterday. When opening the box, this unit was obviously previously returned, the items inside were not wrapped or packaged.Set up the ring light and the remote (switch) does not turn the light on/off. So someone else had the same issues. This unit is going back as well and I will switch to another product.
